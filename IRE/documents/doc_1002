[Autoimmune response in HIV-infected patients is directed against CD4 domain 4]Phage display epitope library technology and a novel computer algorithm have been used for the localization of CD4 epitopes specific for monoclonal antibody (mAb) T6 and autoimmune antibodies found in an HIV infected patient. Both predicted epitope clusters have been shown to overlap and to be localized within the domain 4 of CD4. They included Cys303, Glu304, Glu330, and Lys331 amino acids. Few amino acids predicted by the algorithm as the epitope residues and two residues that did not relate to the epitope were sequentially substituted for Ala. Further analysis of the mutated forms of sCD4 expressed in 293T cells transfected with the corresponding DNAs, supported the predicted localization of the mAb T6 epitope. The results demonstrate that the autoimmune response in HIV-infected patients is directed against domain D4 of sCD4.
