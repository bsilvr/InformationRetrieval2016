An open-label, split-face study comparing the safety and efficacy of levulan kerastick (aminolevulonic acid) plus a 532 nm KTP laser to a 532 nm KTP laser alone for the treatment of moderate facial acne.Recent advances in light therapy coupled with photosensitizers offer alternatives to topical creams and gels and systemic oral agents for acne treatment. To examine the safety and efficacy of the photosensitizer 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in patients with moderate-to-severe acne, a randomized, split-face study, using ALA on one side of the face, was followed by exposure of the entire face to 532 nm potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser. Eight patients completed three treatments for up to 12 weeks. The average acne grading at baseline was 3.20, and improved to 2.12 at 12 weeks (34% improvement). Use of ALA improved acne by 52% compared with 32% on the side that did not receive the photosensitizer. Further studies are warranted to establish optimal parameters for photosensitizer use combined with light therapy for treatment of moderate-to-severe acne; however, the combined use of ALA and a 532 nm laser suggests promising results for acne treatment.
