Topical ALA PDT for the treatment of severe acne vulgaris.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-medicated photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of severe acne vulgaris. METHODS: A total of 78 Chinese patients with Grade 4 severe facial acne were treated with 1-3 courses of ALA PDT. ALA cream (10%) was applied topically to acne lesions for 3 h. The lesions were irradiated by a LED light of 633 nm at dose levels of 50-70 J/cm(2) at 66 mW/cm(2). Clinical assessment was conducted before and after treatment up to 6 months. RESULTS: 22% of patients showed excellent improvement after one-course treatment and another 34% showed excellent improvement after two-course. The rest (44%) required three-course treatment to further reduce the number and size of residual lesions. Adverse effects were minimal. The symptoms and signs in recurrent cases (14%) were much milder and responded well to conventional topical medication. CONCLUSIONS: ALA PDT is a simple, safe and effective therapeutic option for the treatment of severe acne. Further studies to fully understand its mechanisms and optimize its effectiveness are needed.
