Photosensitization-based inactivation of food pathogen Listeria monocytogenes in vitro and on the surface of packaging material.The study was focused on the susceptibility of Listeria monocytogenes ATCL3C 7644 cells and biofilms to non-thermal antimicrobial treatment - photosensitization in vitro and after adhesion to the surface of packaging material. L. monocytogenes was incubated with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (7.5 mM) for 0-2h and illuminated with visible light. The LED-based light source used for the illumination emitted light lambda=400 nm with energy density 20 mW/cm(2). The illumination time varied 0-20 min, and a total light dose reached 0-24 J/cm(2). The obtained data indicate that L. monocytogenes produces endogenous porphyrins after incubation with 7.5mM ALA. Subsequent illumination of cells remarkably inactivates (4 log) them in vitro. Photosensitization diminished population of Listeria cells adhered onto the packaging material by 3.7 log and inactivated bacterial biofilms by 3.1 log. It was shown that antimicrobial efficiency of photosensitization depended on the illumination time, incubation with ALA time as well as on the used ALA concentration. In conclusion, cells and biofilms of L. monocytogenes ATCL3C 7644 can be effectively inactivated by ALA-based photosensitization in the solution as well as adhered onto the surface of packaging material. Obtained data support the idea, that photosensitization as non-thermal and effective antimicrobial treatment has potential to develop into environmentally safe, surface decontamination technique.
