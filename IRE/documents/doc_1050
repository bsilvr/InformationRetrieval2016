Genotoxicity evaluation in workers occupationally exposed to lead.Lead (Pb) is a widely used heavy metal with a broad industrial usage. Nevertheless, Pb is a serious public health issue as it is one of the most widespread environmental and industrial toxins. The aim of this investigation was to assess the genotoxicity of Pb using the comet assay, micronucleus (MN) and chromosomal aberrations (CA) test. Blood and urinary Pb content, levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase in the erythrocytes (E-ALAD) and delta-aminolevulinic acid in urine (U-ALA) were determined. The exposure associated oxidative stress was also studied. The study group comprised of 90 male Pb recovery unit workers and 90 matched controls. The results indicated that the exposed workers had a significantly higher mean comet tail length than that of controls (P&lt;0.05). Analysis of micronuclei in buccal epithelial cells (BEC's) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) revealed that there was a significant increase in frequency of MN in exposed subjects than controls. The frequency of aberrant metaphases was also found to be significantly elevated in the Pb exposed workers. The levels of antioxidant enzymes were relatively reduced (P&gt;0.05) while the rate of lipid peroxidation was higher in the exposed subjects. Blood and urinary Pb concentrations were found to be higher in exposed workers than in controls. E-ALAD levels were reduced and U-ALA levels were elevated in the exposed subjects in comparison to controls. Results of analysis, taking the confounding factors into consideration provide evidence for the association of Pb exposure and genotoxicity, and predict the increased risk of cancer to the exposed workers. In view of the observed results, it can be strongly concluded that the workers comprise the risk group and adequate safety, precautionary and preventive measures could only minimize exposure and the related health hazards.
