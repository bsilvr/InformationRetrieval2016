5-aminolaevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy for the treatment of cervical condylomata acuminata.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) on cervical condylomata acuminata. METHODS: Patients with cervical condylomata (n=30) were allocated into primary and recurrent group, and were given topical ALA under occlusive dressing for 3 hours followed by irradiation with semiconductor laser at a dose of 100 Jcm(-2) and a power of 100 mW. The treatment was repeated 7 days later if the lesion was not completely removed after the first treatment. Complete response rate and recurrence rate of wart lesions as well as rate of adverse reaction were analyzed. RESULTS: The total complete response rate of PDT was 100% and the total recurrence rate was 5% after 3 months of follow-up. Recurrence rate of recurrent group was significantly lower than that of prior managements (100%, P&lt;0.01). The side effects of PDT in patients mainly included mild burning and/or stinging restricted to the illuminated areas, and was significant lower than their own control (25% vs. 100%, P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional therapies, topical application of ALA-PDT is a simple, effective, safe, well-tolerated, and low recurrence rate treatment for cervical condylomata acuminata.
