Predictors of initial AA-related helping: findings from project MATCH.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to identify the factors that predict initial Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)-related helping following treatment admission. METHOD: Data were derived from Project MATCH (Matching Alcoholism Treatments to Client Heterogeneity), a longitudinal investigation of the efficacy of three behavioral treatments for alcohol abuse and dependence. Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed to determine the extent to which demographic, clinical, belief, and AA factors predicted initial AA-related helping. RESULTS: Demographic characteristics, drinking severity, antisocial personality, and purpose in life were not associated with initial AA-related helping. Increased self-efficacy, faith-based practices, meeting attendance, number of steps worked, having a sponsor, and length of sobriety predicted initial AA-related helping. Alcoholics reported elevated depressive symptoms before initial AA-related helping, lowered depressive symptoms at the start of AA-related helping, and similarly lowered depressive symptoms in the interval following initial AA-related helping. CONCLUSIONS: The profile of prospective helpers in AA is not limited to alcoholics from certain backgrounds or higher functioning in terms of drinking or clinical severity. To increase participation in AA-related helping, and hence outcomes, results suggest strengthening self-efficacy and progress in other AA programmatic components.
