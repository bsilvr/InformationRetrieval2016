Time-dependent changes in lead and delta-aminolevulinic acid after subchronic lead exposure in rats.The time-dependent changes in lead (Pb) concentrations in major tissues, serum and urine, and the Pb biomarker delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) concentration in urine were studied in rats after sub-chronic Pb exposure. Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to Pb in drinking water at concentrations of 100 ppm and 1000 ppm for 30 days. The Pb concentration in muscle, liver, kidney, plasma and urine, and the ALA concentration in urine were determined during exposure and every 7 days after exposure for 3 weeks. The muscle Pb concentration did not change post exposure. The liver Pb concentration increased 2.2 to 2.8 times (100 ppm group) and 3.9 to 7.4 times (1000 ppm group) during exposure, then decreased rapidly. Kidney Pb concentrations were 8.0 to 14.3 times (100 ppm group) and 13.8 to 28.5 times (1000 ppm group) higher than controls during exposure and decreased for 1 to 2 weeks post exposure. Plasma Pb concentrations were 1.2 to 3.3 times (100 ppm group) and 2.9 to 5.8 times (1000 ppm group) higher than control concentrations during exposure and decreased time-dependently in the 1000-ppm group after exposure. Urine Pb concentrations were 8.5 to 10.7 times (100 ppm group) and 30.4 to 51.1 times (1000 ppm group) higher than control concentrations during exposure and rapidly decreased after exposure, though concentrations remained up to 4 times higher than controls in the 1000 ppm exposure group. Urine ALA concentrations increased 1.7 to 2.6 and 7.1 to 32.7 times during exposure in the 100 ppm and 1000 ppm groups respectively, and remained elevated for 21 days post exposure. Our data support that urine Pb concentration is a useful marker for acute Pb exposure or post exposure. Urine ALA may be a predicator of biological response to Pb exposure.
