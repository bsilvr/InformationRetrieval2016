Hexyl aminolevulinate fluorescence cystoscopy in bladder cancer.Although bladder cancer occurs frequently, early diagnosis and complete removal of malignant lesions usually lead to good clinical outcomes. In the USA, white light cystoscopy (WLC) is commonly used for bladder cancer diagnosis and guidance of the surgical resection. However, with WLC malignant and precancerous lesions may be missed, resulting in a high rate of disease recurrence. Monitoring for and treating these recurrences carry high direct and indirect costs. Because hexyl aminolevulinate (HAL; 5-ALA-hexylester) fluorescence cystoscopy has greater sensitivity than WLC, especially for detecting early stage lesions, and its use provides more complete resection and lower disease recurrence, it has been recommended in European clinical guidelines. This article reports our own HAL experiences and first time recurrence data, describes how HAL was developed, provides key clinical trial results, and discusses how HAL, which has revolutionized fluorescence cystoscopy and bladder cancer care in Europe, may ultimately revolutionize bladder cancer care in the USA.
