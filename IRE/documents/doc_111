Twelve-step facilitation in non-specialty settings.Participation in the twelve-step mutual-help organization, Alcoholics Anonymous, has proven to be an effective means of helping individuals with alcohol dependence achieve lasting sobriety. Although many patients choose to attend AA of their own accord, clinicians' facilitation of AA involvement ( Twelve-Step Facilitation  [TSF]) has shown to substantially increase the likelihood that patients will become engaged with these freely available resources. Importantly, many individuals with alcohol dependence never seek help from addiction specialists, yet often encounter other health professionals due to alcohol-related physical or psychological problems providing an opportunity for intervention. However, for clinicians who do not specialize in addiction treatment, knowledge about what AA actually is and does is often lacking, and confidence in implementing TSF strategies is low. This chapter provides essential information for clinicians working in non-specialty settings who have little knowledge of, or experience with, AA or TSF, but who may wish to utilize proven strategies to augment existing interventions by helping educate, link, and engage patients with AA. Detailed information on the origins and specific elements of AA is provided along with recommended TSF approaches and strategies to aid the non-specialist in building effective interventions for patients with alcohol dependence.
