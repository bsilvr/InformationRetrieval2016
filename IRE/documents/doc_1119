[Fluorescence guided resection of malignant brain tumors - breakthrough in the surgery of brain tumors]Malignant gliomas, among others the glioblastoma multiforme, are the most frequent brain tumors. The glioblastoma itself represents the most unfavorable tumor. In Switzerland, about 450 humans contract a glioblastoma each year. The median survival time is under 12 months, thus the prognosis is dismal despite a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgical resection presents the major constituent in the management of patients with a glioblastoma. Postoperative radio- and chemotherapy have beneficial effects on the survival time and quality of life. Surgical removal of glioblastomas is challenging due to their infiltrative growth pattern. Therefore, the target extent of resection can only be achieved partially. For some time now, a new in Germany developed method is used in the Neurosurgical Clinic of the Cantonal Hospital in St. Gallen: The 5-ALA-guided microsurgical resection method allows a targeted and secure surgical resection of the tumor. A preoperative administered substance colors the tumor and makes it better visible for the neurosurgeon. Consequently, the healthy brain tissue can be better distinguished from the tumor. This permits not only a larger complete surgical resection of the tumor but also minimizes the resection of healthy tissue.
