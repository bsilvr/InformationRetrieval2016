Dietary source of stearidonic acid promotes higher muscle DHA concentrations than linolenic acid in hybrid striped bass.Rapid expansion of aquacultural production is placing increasing demand on fish oil supplies and intensified the search for alternative lipid sources. Many of the potential alternative sources contain low concentrations of long chain n-3 fatty acids and the conversion of dietary linolenic acid to longer chain highly unsaturated fatty acids is a relatively inefficient process in some species. A 6-week study was conducted to compare tissue fatty acid (FA) concentrations in hybrid striped bass fed either 18:3n-3 (alpha-linolenic acid; ALA) or 18:4n-3 (stearidonic acid; SDA). Hybrid striped bass were fed either a control diet containing fish oil, or diets containing ALA or SDA at three different levels (0.5, 1 and 2% of the diet). There were no significant differences in whole animal responses between fish fed ALA or SDA. Liver and muscle concentrations of ALA and SDA were responsive to dosages fed. However, only 22:6n-3 concentrations in muscle were significantly affected by dietary source of 18 carbon precursors. Muscle 22:6n-3 concentrations were significantly higher in fish fed SDA compared to fish fed ALA. Based on these data, it appears that feeding SDA can increase long chain n-3 fatty acid concentrations in fish muscle.
