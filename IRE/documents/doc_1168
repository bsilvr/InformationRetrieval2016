Alpha-linolenic acid-rich flaxseed oil ingestion increases plasma adiponectin level in rats.Adiponectin, an adipose-specific secretory protein, exhibits antidiabetic and antiatherogenic properties. The effect of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) on adiponectin has not been revealed. ALA is included abundantly in vegetable oils such as flaxseed oil. In this study, we attempted to clarify the effect of ALA-rich flaxseed oil (FSO) intake on the adiponectin level in rats. Seven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed test diets containing high oleic safflower oil (HOSO) or FSO for 4 weeks. After the experimental period, the plasma adiponectin concentration in the FSO-fed group was higher than that in the HOSO-fed group. The adiponectin content of perirenal adipose tissue in the FSO-fed group was also significantly higher than that in the HOSO-fed group. However, the adiponectin mRNA level in the perirenal adipose tissue did not differ significantly between the HOSO-fed and FSO-fed groups. In this study, we clarified the effect of the ALA-rich FSO ingestion on the plasma adiponectin concentration in rats. It was suggested that the ALA-rich FSO intake might exhibit beneficial effects through an increase of the adiponectin level.
