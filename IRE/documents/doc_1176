Enzymatic enrichment of egg-yolk phosphatidylcholine with alpha-linolenic acid.alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA) was incorporated at 28% into the sn-1 position of egg-yolk phospatidylcholine using Novozyme 435 in one-step transesterification process. Using phospholipase A(2) in a two-step process gave 25% incorporation of ALA into the sn-2 position.
