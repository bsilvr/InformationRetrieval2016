Inflammatory markers are not altered by an eight week dietary alpha-linolenic acid intervention in healthy abdominally obese adult males and females.Atherogenesis is thought to be mediated by local and/or systemic production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and omega-3 fatty acids have been implicated in reducing these inflammatory markers. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of an isocaloric diet supplemented with a plant-based dietary omega-3 fatty acid [alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)] on interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Subjects included healthy adult males and females (approximately 79% female, average age 38 years) with increased waist circumference (mean WC=99 cm) and body mass index (mean BMI=29.8 kg/m(2)) who were free of chronic disease, not taking medications, and sedentary. Control subjects (n=24) did not to alter their habitual diet and the ALA group (n=27) followed an enriched ALA diet by using flaxseed oil capsules (increasing ALA to 5% of total energy intake) and lowered their dietary fat consumption by a commensurate amount. Fasting blood samples were obtained before and after the 8-week intervention. We found no significant changes in the inflammatory factors after this 8-week dietary intervention. This study suggests there are no beneficial effects of an 8-week ALA intervention on these inflammatory factors among young, healthy, overweight/obese subjects whose inflammatory factors are not significantly elevated.
