What do adolescents exposed to Alcoholics Anonymous think about 12-step groups?OBJECTIVES: Referral to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) is a common continuing care recommendation. Evidence suggests some youth benefit, yet, despite referrals, youth participation is low. Little is known about adolescents' experiences of AA/NA. Greater knowledge would inform and help tailor aftercare recommendations. METHOD: Two clinical samples of youth (N = 74 and N= 377) were asked about their perceptions of, and experiences with, AA/NA with responses categorized by content into domains assessed for face validity and reliability. RESULTS: The aspects of AA/NA youth liked best were general group dynamic processes related to universality, support, and instillation of hope. The most common reason for discontinuing was boredom/lack of fit. CONCLUSIONS: General group-therapeutic, and not 12-step-specific, factors are most valued by youth during early stages of recovery and/or degree of AA/NA exposure. Many youth discontinue due to a perceived lack of fit, suggesting a mismatch between some youth and aspects of AA/NA.
