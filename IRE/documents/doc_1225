The influence of dietary linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid on body composition and the activities of key enzymes of hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in mice.We have recently suggested that feeding the C18 polyunsaturated fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), instead of linoleic acid (LA) reduced body fat in mice. However, the difference in body fat did not reach statistical significance, which prompted us to carry out this study using more animals and diets with higher contents of ALA and LA so that the contrast would be greater. The diets contained either 12% (w/w) LA and 3% ALA or 12% ALA and 4% LA. A low-fat diet was used as control. The diets were fed for 35 days. The proportion of body fat was not influenced by the type of dietary fatty acid. Plasma total cholesterol and phospholipids were significantly lower in ALA-fed mice than in mice fed LA. Activities of enzymes in the fatty acid oxidation pathway were significantly raised by these two diets when compared with the control diet. alpha-Linolenic acid vs. LA did not affect fatty acid oxidation enzymes. In mice fed the diet with LA activities of enzymes of de novo fatty acid synthesis were significantly decreased when compared with mice fed the control diet. alpha-Linolenic acid vs. LA feeding did not influence lipogenic enzymes. It is concluded that feeding mice for 35 days with diets either rich in LA or ALA did not significantly influence body composition.
