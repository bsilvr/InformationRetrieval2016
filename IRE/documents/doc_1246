Effect of streptavidin on cardiac allograft prolongation is due to host T-Cell suppression.AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of streptavidin immunomodulation in the high-responder WF-to-Lewis combination. METHODS/RESULTS: We examined the effects of streptavidin on the proliferative response of T cells in coculture studies. Two to 200 microg/mL streptavidin significantly (P &lt; .001) suppressed the proliferation of Lewis T cells to WF by 76%-83% compared with untreated responders. Next, we studied the survival of WF cardiac allografts in Lewis recipients pretreated with streptavidin. A 5-day course of peritransplantation recipient treatment with streptavidin doses of 8, 12, 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg combined with single dose of 0.5 mL antilymphocyte serum (ALS) significantly (P &lt; .001) prolonged cardiac allograft survival from MST of 7 +/- 0.5 and 8 +/- 0.5 days in naive and ALS-treated controls to 15 +/- 1, 20 +/- 3, 16 +/- 3, 17 +/- 3, and 23 +/- 2 days, respectively. In contrast, posttransplantation administration of 80 mg/kg streptavidin resulted in animal death, suggesting toxicity of this dose. Additionally, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg streptavidin administration for 10 consecutive days resulted in significant graft prolongation (MST of 18 +/- 1 and 21 +/- 1 days, respectively; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: Although peritransplantation streptavidin treatment is effective in prolonging rat cardiac allografts in the high-responder WF-to-Lewis combination, it does not induce permanent graft survival as observed in the low-responder combination of Lewis-to-ACI. Our finding of in vitro immunomodulatory effect of streptavidin on T-cell proliferation suggests that its in vivo effect is partly due to prevention of T-cell activation following antigen exposure.
