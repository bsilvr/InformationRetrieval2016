Induction of tolerance to hind limb allografts in rats receiving cyclosporine A and antilymphocyte serum: effect of duration of the treatment.BACKGROUND: This study assessed the ability of antilymphocyte serum (ALS) and cyclosporine A (CsA) to induce tolerance for hind limb composite tissue allograft in rats without chronic immunosuppression. METHODS: Hind limb transplantations were performed in Lewis-Brown-Norway (LBN, RT1(1+n)) and Lewis (LEW, RT1(1)) rats. Treatment consisted of ALS only (0.4 mL/kg), CsA only (16 mg/kg), and a combination of CsA and ALS, and it was administered 12 hr before surgery at three different intervals (7, 14, and 21 days). Long-term survivors were tested for tolerance by standard skin grafting from the recipient (LEW), the donor (LBN), and the third party (ACI, RT1 ) 60 days after cessation of the treatment and by mixed lymphocyte reaction at 100 days. T-cell lines were analyzed with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Single use of ALS in all treatment intervals did not prolong allograft survival. Single use of CsA extended survival up to 23 days in the 21-day protocol group. CsA and ALS caused indefinite survival in two of six rats in the 14-day protocol and in all six rats in the 21-day protocol (&gt;420 days). The six long-term survivors in the 21-day protocol accepted the skin grafts from the donor (LBN) and the recipient (LEW) and rejected third-party grafts (ACI). Tolerant animals showed a donor-specific hematopoietic chimerism of 35% to 42% in the peripheral blood. Mixed lymphocyte reaction assay demonstrated tolerance to the host and donor alloantigens and increased response to the third party. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of CsA and ALS for 21 days induced donor-specific tolerance in the recipients of the rat hind limb composite tissue allografts. The mechanism of tolerance should be investigated further.
