Role of transplant induction therapy on recurrence rate of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.Individuals with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are at risk for recurrence of disease following renal transplantation. The rate of recurrence has been estimated to range from 20% to 30%. The factors associated with an increased probability of recurrence are not known, although the rapidity of progression of disease, age at onset, and the presence of diffuse mesangial proliferation in the native kidney have all been implicated. We analyzed the data from 35 patients with FSGS who received 37 renal transplants at this institution between October 1968 and December 1997. Recurrence was diagnosed by the development of nephrotic-range proteinuria and a transplant biopsy compatible with the diagnosis. Sixteen recurrences were noted, with an overall recurrence rate of 43%. The risk of recurrence was associated with the use of antilymphocytic serum (ALS) for initial induction therapy; being 11% in those who received no induction therapy versus 53% in those who received ALS. Furthermore, in the latter group, the rate of recurrence was 88% in those who received antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM) versus 40% in those who received Minnesota antilymphocytic globulin. Factors such as race, sex, age at time of diagnosis, rapidity of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), response to alkylating agents and/or cyclosporin therapy prior to ESRD, age at time of transplant, donor source, and triple or double immunosuppressive therapy did not appear to have an effect on the rate of recurrence. We conclude that induction therapy with ALS at time of transplantation increases the risk of recurrence of FSGS following renal transplantation.
