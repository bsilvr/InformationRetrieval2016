[Effect of immunosuppressive agents and antilymphocyte serum on bacterial translocation in mice]Following intraperitoneally applied treatment with 0.5 ml of ana partes diluted antilymphocyte serum (ALS) of immunosuppressive effect no bacterial translocation (BT) was observed in mice. The ALS treatment applied in combination with other immunosuppressive agents such as lymphotropic cytostatics as dianhydrogalactitol (30 mg/kg) or chlorpromazine (75 mg/kg) did not increase the mice drug sensitivity to used agents. According to our results, ALS can be suitable for combined application with other immunosuppressive agents as it can increase immunosuppression without side-effects such as those induced by bacterial translocation.
