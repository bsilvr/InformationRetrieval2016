A partial conditioning strategy for achieving mixed chimerism in the rat: tacrolimus and anti-lymphocyte serum substantially reduce the minimum radiation dose for engraftment.Development of partial conditioning strategies to achieve reliable engraftment of allogeneic bone marrow with minimum recipient morbidity could extend the therapeutic application of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to enzyme deficiency states, hemoglobinopathies, autoimmune diseases, and the induction of tolerance for solid organ and cellular allografts. In this study we describe a nonmyeloablative rat BMT model and examine the effect of clinically available immunosuppressants on the minimum amount of total body irradiation (TBI) required for allogeneic engraftment. Donor ACI marrow was depleted of T cells using immunomagnetic beads and transplanted to major histocompatibility complex- and minor antigen-mismatched Wistar Furth (WF) rats (ACI --&gt; WF) conditioned with varying doses of TBI. Recipients conditioned with TBI alone required myeloablation with 1000 cGy for reliable allogeneic marrow engraftment. Administration to WF recipients of a single dose of anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) 5 days prior to BMT together with a limited course of tacrolimus (1 mg/kg/day) resulted in engraftment of ACI bone marrow at only 500 cGy TBI. ACI --&gt; WF recipients were stable mixed chimeras (mean donor chimerism 49% at 330 days post-BMT). Chimerism was multilineage. All recipient animals were free of graft-versus-host disease. These results suggest that a nonmyeloablative conditioning strategy based on low-dose TBI and a limited course of tacrolimus plus ALS can produce long-term mixed multilineage chimerism.
