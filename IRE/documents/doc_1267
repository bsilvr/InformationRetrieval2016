Use of pharmacologic immunosuppression to augment the specific unresponsiveness (tolerance) to skin allografts induced by donor-specific bone marrow in antilymphocyte serum-treated mice: the unique effect of sirolimus.Tolerance produced with ALS treatment, DSBM, and sirolimus involves multiple mechanisms of a specific and nonspecific nature. In eventual clinical application for tolerance induction, sirolimus (rapamycin) has great potential for augmenting the tolerogenicity of the ALS/BM regimen.
