Use of CTLA4-Ig in combination with conventional immunosuppressive agents to prolong allograft survival.BACKGROUND: The objective of our study was to determine the effectiveness of CTLA4-Ig, a novel immunosuppressive agent, in augmenting allograft survival when combined with either cyclosporine, sirolimus, donor-specific bone marrow alone (BM), or bone marrow in conjunction with antilymphocyte serum (ALS). METHODS: Full-thickness skin allografts were used in C3H to B6AF1 (class I mismatch) and AKR to C57BL/6 (complete mismatch) models. Groups of mice (n=6-14) were treated with various combinations of the following treatment protocols: murine CTLA4-Ig, L-6 control Ig, sirolimus, cyclosporine, ALS, or ALS/BM. RESULTS: In the class I mismatch model, L-6 control Ig had no effect whereas use of CTLA4-Ig alone resulted in a doubling of the median graft survival compared with controls. The addition of either sirolimus or cyclosporine to CTLA4-Ig increased graft survival over that achieved with CTLA4-Ig alone. CTLA4-Ig demonstrated no efficacy when used in combination with BM, ALS, or ALS/BM. CTLA4-Ig was clearly less effective in the complete mismatch model. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CTLA4-Ig may be effective clinically in combination with cyclosporine or sirolimus but offers no additional effectiveness in combination with antilymphocyte serum with or without donor-specific bone marrow.
