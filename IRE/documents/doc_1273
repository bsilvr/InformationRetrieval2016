[Control of autoimmune processes by natural and other non-harmful methods]At present an increase of some autoaggressive diseases can be observed. The commonly used treatment consists of the administration of some immunosuppressive drug of some hormonal preparations. This type of therapy is accompanied by some undesired side effects, as these drugs influence also some other cell systems besides the immunologically active cells. These drugs are also known to lower the resistance to some intercurrent infections. Due to these undesired side effects some naturally occurring factors are introduced into the therapy. These are e.g., TGF-beta, or some interleukins (IL-10 etc.). In our department and immunosuppressively acting substance was isolated from DHL which had the ability to inhibit the AA (adjuvant arthritis) in rats. In humans this SF (suppressive factor) stimulates the CD 8+ cells which are known to have suppressoric activity. This SF was successfully applied in some autoaggressive diseases, e.g., atopic eczema, multiple sclerosis, some polyradiculoenuritis, amyotropic lateral sclerosis etc. In this paper the results in the ALS patients are given. Amongst other possibilities of the therapy the application of antilymphocyte sera, monoclonal antibodies to some CD markers of lymphocytes and some methods of hyposensitizations of tolerance induction are mentioned. Further, an original method using antigen bound to isosoluble carrier is described. This administration of encephalitogen bound onto Sforon (polyacrylate spheres) sis not only inhibit the EAE manifestations but also enable the survival of guinea-pigs which had already manifested the clinical signs of EAE.
