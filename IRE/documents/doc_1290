Marked prolongation of rat skin xenografts induced by intrathymic injection of xenogeneic splenocytes and a short course of rapamycin in antilymphocyte serum-treated mice.The effect of intrathymic (IT) injection of donor splenocytes and a short course of rapamycin (Rapa) treatment on rat to mouse skin xenograft survival was investigated. ACI rat skin xenografts were transplanted to (C57BL/6 x A)F1 mice treated with rabbit anti-mouse lymphocyte serum (ALS) on days -1, +2, and +4 relative to skin grafting on day 0. Fifty million donor-type splenocytes were injected intrathymically on day 7 after transplantation. Rapa was given intraperitoneally every other day from day 0 to day 12 at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg. Prolonged skin xenograft survival was observed in ALS- and Rapa-treated recipients (no IT injection) with a median survival time of 47 days. However, skin graft survival was markedly more prolonged in the group treated with ALS, Rapa, and IT injection of donor splenocytes did not have a beneficial effect on skin xenograft survival in ALS-treated recipients. An increased presence of donor-type cells was observed in the thymus of the ALS- and Rapa-treated recipients for 7 days after IT injection of donor splenocytes. In conclusion, a short course of Rapa markedly augments rat skin xenograft survival in ALS-treated mice injected intrathymically with donor-type splenocytes.
