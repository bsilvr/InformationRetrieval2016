Does intrathymic injection of alloantigen-presenting cells before islet allo-transplantation prolong graft survival?Current immunosuppressive agents have potentially dangerous side-effects, are non-specific and most are also diabetogenic. We investigated tolerance induction with intrathymic injection of purified antigen-presenting cells (APC) plus a single dose of antilymphocyte serum (ALS) intraperitoneally before allogeneic islet transplantation in the rat model WAG to Lewis (RT1u to RT1l). Purified donor APC [non-parenchymal cells (NPC) or dendritic cells (DC)] were prepared from liver and spleen, respectively. Isograft function for more than 120 days proved that islet isolation, purification and transplantation procedures were adequate. A total of WAG DC (4 x 10(5)) or NPC (2 x 10(6)) in 20 microl were injected into both lobes of the thymus of 140-210 g Lewis recipients followed by a single injection of ALS. Three days later, diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Four days later allogeneic islets were grafted into the liver by intraportal injection of 3000 WAG islets. Control animals (n = 8) received 20 microl saline intrathymically instead of APC. Graft function was assessed by blood glucose measurements with glucose levels above 15 mmol/l on 3 consecutive days defined as graft rejection. Animals given DC (n = 9) or NPC (n = 8) intrathymically plus 1 ml of ALS, rejected their grafts in an accelerated fashion with a median survival time (MST) of 3 days. However, control animals rejected their grafts with a MST of 7 days, but with two animals surviving for more than 2 months. In conclusion, intrathymic inoculation with purified APC plus a single dose of ALS did not prolong allogeneic islet graft function but induced accelerated rejection of the islet allografts.
