[Characteristics of the cellular reactions of the T- and B-dependent areas of the regional lymph nodes in dogs to the administration of immunodepressants]Mesenteric, bifurcational, axillary and popliteal lymph nodes have been studied in 22 healthy mature male dogs. Amount of blast cells, small lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages has been taken into account in the paracortical zone, in the germinative centers and in the medullary cords. For two weeks to one group of the animals every day imuran in turn with aurantin (10 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg) are injected, or antilymphocytic serum (ALS) intraperitoneally every other day (0.1 ml/kg). The combined injection of imuran and aurantin produces a more pronounced toxic effect to the hemopoietic organs than ALS. ALS is more specific for T-dependent zones of the lymph nodes. In the dose and interval mentioned ALS is an immunostimulating preparation for the immunocompetent cells of the germinative centers of the lymph nodes. The reaction of the lymph nodes depends on their regional belonging.
