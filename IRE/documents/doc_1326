Studies in small bowel transplantation. Prevention of graft-versus-host disease with preservation of allograft function by donor pretreatment with antilymphocyte serum.Donor pretreatment with antilymphocyte serum (ALS) effectively prevents graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a unidirectional (parent-to-F1 hybrid) rat small bowel transplantation model. ALS must be administered prior to or at the time of transplantation, and the intraperitoneal route is more effective than subcutaneous administration. Donor pretreatment with ALS uniformly prevents GVHD without impairing subsequent allograft function as measured by absorption of dietary energy and nitrogen, weight gain, and bowel morphology. These rodent studies suggest that ALS treatment of donors as well as recipients in small bowel transplantation may be a highly effective, simple, and easily applicable method to prevent or ameliorate GVHD in human small bowel transplantation.
