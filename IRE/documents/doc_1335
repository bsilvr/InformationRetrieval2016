Specific tolerance to canine renal allografts following treatment with fractionated bone marrow and antilymphocyte serum.These results suggest (1) that ALS + BM fractions can be used to promote tolerance in long-term graft survivors; (2) that the presence of apparent BM cells of donor origin in the allograft in normally functioning kidneys may be related to the mechanism of allograft prolongation, and (3) that some promise of possible specific long-term immunosuppression exists clinically.
