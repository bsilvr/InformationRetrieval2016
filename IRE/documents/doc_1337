Paraoxonase gene mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Three clustered, homologous paraoxonase genes (PON1, PON2, and PON3) have roles in preventing lipid oxidation and detoxifying organophosphates. Recent reports describe a genetic association between the PON genes and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We now report that in genomic DNA from individuals with familial and sporadic ALS, we have identified at least 7 PON gene mutations that are predicted to alter PON function.
