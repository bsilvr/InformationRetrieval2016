Health-related quality of life in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.The aim was to assess factors that might influence health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with two different neuromuscular disorders - myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A cross-sectional study was performed on 79 patients with DM1 and 74 with ALS. The HRQoL was evaluated by SF-36, Serbian version. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton rating scale for depression and the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety respectively. Severity of muscular involvement in DM1 was measured with MRC scale and severity of ALS with ALSFRSr score. The mean total score as well as all domain scores of SF-36 were similar in DM1 and ALS patients (p &gt; 0.05), except that ALS patients experienced less bodily pain (p &lt; 0.05). Depressiveness was found in 51% and marked anxiety in 38% of DM1 patients. Emotional status and severity of muscular involvement emerged as significant independent contributing factors to the total SF-36 in DMI patients (p &lt; 0.05). Only 3% of ALS patients showed depressiveness and 4% anxiety symptoms. The factors found to contribute to HRQoL in ALS patients were severity of disease and educational level ofpatients (p &lt; 0.05). We found significant percentage of potentially treatable emotional disturbances which together with severity of disease significantly contributed to HRQoL in DM1 patients. On the other hand, in ALS patients depressiveness and anxious symptoms were uncommon and the factors found to contribute to HRQoL were severity of disease and educational level.
