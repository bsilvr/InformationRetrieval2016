CSF chemokine alterations related to the clinical course of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.We measured the levels of 27 cytokines/chemokines and growth factors in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 42 patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 12 patients with lower motor neuron disease (LMND), and 34 control patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases (OND), using a multiplexed fluorescent bead-based immunoassay. Among cytokines/chemokines elevated in ALS, CCL2 and CXCL8 levels were negatively correlated with the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) score, while CCL4 showed a positive correlation with ALSFRS-R score. CCL4 and CXCL10 showed negative correlations with disease progression rate. These chemokine alterations are assumed to somehow correlate with the clinical course of ALS.
