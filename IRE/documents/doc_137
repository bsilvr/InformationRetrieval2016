Spirituality in alcoholics during treatment.The purpose of this study was to measure spiritual well-being (SWB), private religious practices (PRP), positive religious coping, abstinence self-efficacy (AASE), affiliation with AA (AAA), and their associations with alcoholics in treatment. Seventy-four adults in a three-week outpatient addiction treatment program were assessed at admission and discharge. Wilcoxon signed rank and t tests demonstrated significant increases in all variables. Spearman correlation coefficients detected significant associations between the spiritual variables, SWB and AASE, as well as PRP and AAA. Findings suggest that spiritual variables can change during treatment and that there may be connections between spiritual variables and variables associated with longer-term recovery.
