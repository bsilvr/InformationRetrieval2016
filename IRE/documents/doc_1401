Human adipose-derived stem cells enhance the glutamate uptake function of GLT1 in SOD1(G93A)-bearing astrocytes.Impaired glutamate uptake function of astrocytes associated with accumulation of extracellular glutamate is a well-documented feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Enhancing the uptake function of astrocytic glutamate transport 1 (GLT1) may be a potential treatment for this disease. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) are capable of secreting a large number of cytokines which exhibit diverse pharmacological effects. Therefore, we investigate the influence of the soluble factors released by hADSCs on the GLT1 in primary astrocytes cultured from SOD1(G93A) mice, a widely studied mutant human SOD1 transgenic model of ALS. Our data indicate that soluble factors from hADSCs significantly upregulate the expression of GLT1 in SOD1(G93A)-bearing astrocytes, which result in enhanced glutamate uptake function. The upregulation of GLT1 is accompanied by the inhibition of caspase-3 activation in mutant astrocytes. In addition, we find that hADSCs cocultured with SOD1(G93A)-bearing astrocytes produce more VEGF, HGF and IGF-1, which are reported to have neuroprotective effects. Our results suggest that hADSCs may be a potential candidate in cellular therapy for ALS.
