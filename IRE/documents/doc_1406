Association between DPP6 polymorphism and the risk of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Chinese patients.BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebral cortex, which results in muscle weakness, atrophy. Sporadic ALS (SALS) accounts for about 90% of ALS cases, but the etiology is largely unknown. Most of the researchers consider it to be a complex disease. There have been several genome-wide association (GWA) studies reporting several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which are susceptible to ALS, but no data of Asians (including Chinese) yet. We investigate whether the polymorphism of rs10260404 in DPP6 gene is associated with SALS in Chinese Han origin to compare the ethnic differences between Chinese Han origin and other populations. METHODS: The genomic DNA was extracted from the leukocytes of whole blood samples in 58 Chinese Han patients with SALS and 52 healthy controls. The asymmetric PCR was processed in the presence of an unlabeled probe that contained the rs10260404 locus. The product was genotyped on a light scanner using high resolution melting method and some were confirmed with sequencing. RESULTS: The rs10260404 polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in patients and controls. The CC genotype and the C allele were similar in patients compared with healthy subjects and not associated with an increased risk of Chinese SALS patients (chi(2) = 0.29, OR = 1.26, 95% CI 0.55 - 2.87, P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The rs10260404 is not associated with ALS susceptibility in Chinese people with Han origin which may be due to ethnic differences. More study with large number of cases in Chinese population is really necessary.
