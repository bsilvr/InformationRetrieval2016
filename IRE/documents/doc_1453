American Nurses Association's best practices in seasonal influenza immunization campaign.The American Nurses Association (ANA) is concerned about the unacceptably low rates of seasonal influenza vaccination among registered nurses and other health care personnel. Despite well-documented evidence of the importance and benefits of influenza immunization of health care personnel, seasonal influenza vaccination rates remain below 50%. In response, ANA developed the 2006-2007 Best Practices in Seasonal Influenza Immunization Campaign to assist health care organizations in conducting successful seasonal influenza immunization programs. Best practices in the top recognized programs have been compiled to represent the successful elements in seasonal influenza vaccination programs that result in increased vaccination acceptance and accessibility among health care professionals. ANA developed a brochure, articles, and other tools reflecting the best practices to assist other organizations nationwide in planning their seasonal influenza immunization programs.
