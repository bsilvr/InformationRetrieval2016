PNEGers in Portland.Continuing education and academic and staff development educators participated in an annual American Nurses Association (ANA) Council on Continuing Education conference for many years. When ANA eliminated its councils, the conference was continued by the Professional Nurse Educators Group (PNEG). Each fall, PNEG hosts a conference targeting educators in academia, continuing education, and staff development roles. It is the only conference where common issues can be discussed. This column focuses on the value of participating in PNEG as a way to connect with other educators.
