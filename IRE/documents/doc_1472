Magnet Recognition Program 2005: an update.The Magnet Recognition Program has been revised to simplify instructions, eliminate redundancy, and reduce the documentation burden for applicants. One of the major changes is that required documentation is now categorized by the 14 Forces of Magnetism to match the Scope and Standards for Nurse Administrators (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2004) through the use of a crosswalk matrix. However, in general, the original concepts that characterized Magnet recognition remain intact.
