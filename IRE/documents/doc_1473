Said another way. My definition of nursing.The definition of nursing has evolved since the introduction of the definition by the American Nurses Association in 1980. The society we nurses serve has changed significantly and members of the society demand quality health care and respect for their individual decisions regarding their health care. As a profession, we must keep our fingers on the pulse of society and be ready to respond to the changes of society's needs. Being diligent in defining our position in society is imperative for the preservation of the nursing profession. This paper supports the current definition of the ANA (2003) within the domains of the art, science, and practice of nursing.
