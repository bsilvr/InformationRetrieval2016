Peer review for advanced practice nurses: what does it really mean?Peer review has multiple manifestations and purposes. Two stated purposes are the demonstration of professionalism and clinical competency. The American Nurses Association (ANA) defines nursing peer-review as a process for evaluating the care provided by an individual according to accepted standards. Further, the ANA proposes that nurses with similar rank and clinical expertise should conduct these evaluations. Some local jurisdictions may also mandate that advanced practice nurses (APNs) review one another's care. Therefore, APNs should become familiar with sources for evaluation criteria and tool formats for APN peer review. The advantages and limitations of the various formats and processes of peer review should also be considered.
