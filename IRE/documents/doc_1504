ANA nurse sensitive quality indicators for long-term care facilities.Nurse sensitive quality indicators, developed through the American Nurses Association's (ANA) Safety and Quality Initiative, are key to evaluating the quality of patient care in acute care settings. This study found that the ANA quality indicators were also relevant for long-term care facilities. Long-term care facilities can be part of the ANA Safety and Quality Initiative by collecting and reporting nurse sensitive quality indicators and submitting data to the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators.
