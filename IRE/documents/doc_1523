Ethics in perioperative practice--duty to foster an ethical environment.Though often difficult, ethical decision making is necessary when caring for surgical patients. Perioperative nurses have to recognize ethical dilemmas and be prepared to take action based on the ethical code outlined in the American Nurses Association's (ANA's) Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements. In this sixth of a nine-part series that will help perioperative nurses relate the ANA code to their own area of practice, the author looks at the sixth statement, which emphasizes the nurse's duty to promote a working environment that enhances quality patient care and fosters the values and behaviors that form the foundation of ethical practice.
