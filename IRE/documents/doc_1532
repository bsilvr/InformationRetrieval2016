Nursing quality outcome indicators. The North Dakota Study.The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and conduct a pilot study of the ANA Nursing Care Report Card Study in one state. Clinical indicators studied include agency data, skin integrity, patient falls, and nurse (n = 217) and patient (n = 924) satisfaction. Patients were well satisfied with their care. Nurses were less satisfied, with a significant difference between what was important to their satisfaction and their current level of satisfaction. Important information is included for hospital and nursing service administrators, as well as for nurses.
