Differences in individual efficacy of two Sairei-to preparations (Sojyutu-Sairei-to and Byakujyutu-Sairei-to) on recurrent spontaneous abortions of autoimmune etiologies evaluated by antinuclear antibody and anticardiolipin antibody titers.The differences in individual efficacy of two Sairei-to preparations (Sojyutu-Sairei-to and Byakujyutu-Sairei-to) on antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anticardiolipin antibody (ACLA) positive recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) was analyzed in 52 patients (a total of 61 treatment sessions). Patients who failed to respond to initial treatment with Sojyutu-Sairei-to were additionally treated with Byakujyutu- Sairei-to, and the time course of ANA and ACLA titers in these patients was analyzed. ACLA titers were decreased significantly by the treatment of Byakujyutu-Sairei-to, however, the percentage of successfully prevented abortion cases did not differ significantly between the Sojyutu-Sairei-to treatment group and the Byakujyutu-Sairei-to treatment group. ACLA titer was decreased in all 10 cases where abortion was successfully prevented by the treatment with Sojyutu-Sairei-to or Byakujyutu-Sairei-to. In the cases where both ANA and ACLA were decreased following treatment with Sojyutu-Sairei-to or Byakujyutu-Sairei-to, the percentage of cases rated as  Kyo  and  Rikan  were significantly higher in the Byakujyutu-Sairei-to group. These results indicate that Byakujyutu-Sairei-to is effective against ACLA positive RSA through the antibody-reducing activity, which differs from that of Sojyutu-Sairei-to in individual cases. On the basis of these results, Sairei-to therapy, which is superior to aspirin and heparin in terms of efficacy and safety, is recommended as the first-line therapy for RSA of autoimmune etiologies. Furthermore, to elevate the percentage of successfully prevented abortions, it is advisable to select one of the two Sairei-to preparations (Sojyutu-Sairei-to and Byakujyutu-Sairei-to) on the basis of differential diagnosis using the methods of Oriental medicine.
