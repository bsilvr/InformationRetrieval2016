African-American alcoholics: an interpretive/constructivist model of affiliation with alcoholics anonymous (AA).It is estimated that two million African-Americans suffer directly and indirectly from alcoholism and its related problems. Yet, because of their cultural background, African-American alcoholics do not readily accept that alcoholism is a disease. This study explores how African-American alcoholics modify the steps and traditions of AA to affiliate with the organization. Data was collected from intensive and semi-structured interviews and participant observation. Procedures and analysis generic to grounded theory were used in the context of an interpretive/ constructivist paradigm.
