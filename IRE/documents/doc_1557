[Evaluation of simultaneous detection of specific antinuclear antibodies using multiplexed technology]BioPlex2200 is a fully automated analyzer using multiplexed technology and BioPlex2200 ANA Screen can analyze 11 antinuclear antibodies (ANA). We evaluated simultaneous detection of 11 ANA and clinical utility as ANA screening test. We collected sera from 317 connective tissue disease (CTD) patients, 166 healthy subjects, and 105 sera in which anti dsDNA antibody(RIA) is requested. Detection of 11 ANA were measured by BioPlex2200 ANA Screen using BioPlex2200 along with conventional methods. We evaluated positive ratio for healthy subjects and CTD patients and concordance rate between BioPlex2200 and IF. The prevalence of disease specific ANA in CTD patients were comparable with general occurrence rate except anti dsDNA antibody (39.3%) in SLE. Concordance rate between BioPlex2200 and conventional methods were high(89.0-99.7%) except anti dsDNA antibody(ELISA: 68.8%, RIA: 58.1%). Discordant sera of Bioplex2200+/DID- for anti SS-A antibodies were observed in 30 sera, and 20 sera were positive only for anti 52kD SS-A/Ro antibody. As ANA screening test, positive ratio was low (7.2%) in healthy subjects, and comparable with that of IF(1:160). Concordance rate between BioPlex2200 and IF was low (75.1%). However, 44 sera of BioPlex2200+/IF- contained 6 samples positive for anti Jo-1 antibodies and 29 samples positive for anti-52kD SS-A/Ro antibodies. Diagnostic accuracy of the Medical Decision Support Software (MDSS) by BioPlex2200 as compared to clinical diagnosis is good for specificity. Taken together, BioPlex2200 can appropriately perform simultaneous detection of 11 ANA and detect independently anti-52kD SS-A/Ro antibody. However, detection for anti dsDNA antibody of low titers is needed to be improved.
