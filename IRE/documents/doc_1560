Utility of immunologic parameters in the evaluation of Meniere's disease.CONCLUSION: Because of the lack of association between a positive test and response to corticosteroid treatment, at present, detection of anti-HSP 70 antibody, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or antinuclear antibody (ANA), does not offer clinically useful information in the treatment of Meniere's disease (MD). OBJECTIVES: The study was designed to investigate the performance of various laboratory tests, including anti-HSP 70, TNF-alpha, ESR, ANA, and anti-phospholipid antibodies, in the diagnosis and treatment response of patients with MD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients who presented with MD and 30 healthy people were selected as study and control groups, respectively. The laboratory panel included the following tests: anti-HSP 70 antibody immunoassay, TNF-alpha, ESR, ANA, and anti-phospholipid antibodies. The study group was given corticosteroid therapy and separated into two groups: the corticosteroid responders and the corticosteroid non-responders. In the follow-up, repeat audiograms were evaluated to determine the response to treatment. RESULTS: TNF-alpha was found at significantly lower titers in the study group when compared with the control group (p&lt;0.05). Anti-HSP 70 was not found in high titers in the study group. ANA positivity in patients with MD was not statistically different from the control group. There was no significant difference in the treatment response for any of the parameters tested.
