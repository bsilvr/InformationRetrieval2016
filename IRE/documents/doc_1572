Anti-nuclear antibody reactivity in lupus may be partly hard-wired into the primary B-cell repertoire.When monoclonal ANAs and non-ANAs generated from a genetically simplified mouse model of lupus, B6.Sle1, were recently compared, the ANAs exhibited three sequence motifs in their immunoglobulin heavy chains, including increased cationicity in CDR3 ( motif A ), reduced anionicity in CDR2 ( motif B ) and increased aspartate at H50 ( motif C ). The present study was designed to elucidate the extent to which these ANA-associated sequence motifs might be hard-wired into the primary B-cell repertoire in lupus. The immunoglobulin heavy chain sequence of total splenic B-cells, follicular B-cells and marginal zone B-cells from B6.Sle1 congenic mice and C57BL/6 controls were amplified by single-cell PCR and compared. Analysis of the primary immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoire indicated that the first two sequence motifs  A  and  B  were already encoded in the na√Øve repertoire of B6.Sle1(z) mice, whereas the third motif  C  was introduced in part by somatic mutation. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that non-anionic CDR2 and cationic CDR3 residues in the immunoglobulin heavy chain facilitated nuclear antigen binding in concert, whereas aspartate at H50 strongly vetoed DNA-binding, while preserving nucleosome reactivity. Hence, anti-nuclear antibodies appear to arise as a consequence of two distinct processes-genetically programmed selection of specific CDR charge motifs into the primary immunoglobulin repertoire, with secondary contribution from somatic mutation. Polymorphisms in the lupus susceptibility gene Ly108 that impair central B-cell tolerance may be mechanistically responsible for these early repertoire differences in lupus.
