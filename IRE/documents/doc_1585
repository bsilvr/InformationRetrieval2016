[Clinical significance of dense fine speckled pattern in anti-nuclear antibody test using indirect immunofluorescence method]BACKGROUND: Dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern in antinuclear antibody (ANA) test using indirect immunofluorescence method became to be known recently and it is detected in patients with various chronic inflammatory diseases as well as in healthy individuals. We investigated the relation between DFS pattern and various diseases. METHODS: ANA tests by indirect immunofluorescence method using HEp-2 cell line slide (Kallestad; Bio-Rad, USA) were performed in 2,654 patients for screening of systemic autoimmune diseases. The frequencies of ANA and DFS positivity were analyzed according to sex, age, clinical department and disease. RESULTS: ANA was positive in 13.3% (352/2,654) of the total patients, and the frequency of DFS pattern was observed in 3.8% (101/2,654) of the total patients and in 28.7% (101/352) of the patients with ANA positivity. Higher frequency of DFS positivity was observed in patients referred from Departments of Rheumatology and Nephrology, but there was no difference in the frequencies of DFS positivity among the patients with ANA positivity. The frequency of DFS pattern was higher in seborrheic dermatitis (14.3%), herpes zoster (11.1%), rheumatoid arthritis (16.9%), systemic lupus erythematosus (15.4%) and Sjogren syndrome (14.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The DFS pattern is a frequent finding (about 28% of ANA positivity) in ANA test using indirect immunofluorescence method. Relatively high frequency of DFS pattern was observed in autoimmune diseases, contrary to the previous observations that DFS pattern is not related with autoimmune diseases. Further studies including the confirmation tests of anti-DFS70 are needed for the identification of relation between DFS pattern and particular diseases.
