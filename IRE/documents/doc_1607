Utility of anti-HSP 70, TNF-alpha, ESR, antinuclear antibody, and antiphospholipid antibodies in the diagnosis and treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the performance of various laboratory tests used for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial. METHODS: Thirty patients who presented with SSNHL and 30 healthy people with no cochleovestibular disorders were selected as study and control groups. The laboratory panel includes the following tests: anti-HSP 70 antibody immunoassay, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), antinuclear antibody (ANA), and antiphospholipid antibodies. The study group was given corticosteroid therapy and separated into two groups: the corticosteroid responders and the corticosteroid nonresponders. In the follow-up, repeat audiograms were evaluated to determine the response to treatment. RESULTS: TNF-alpha was found at lower titers in the study group when compared with the control group in contrast to other studies. Also, anti-HSP 70 was not found in high titers in the study group. ANA and ESR were the two parameters that were significantly more positive in the study group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the lack of association between a positive test and response to corticosteroid treatment, detection of the anti-HSP 70 antibody, TNF-alpha, ESR, and ANA, at present, do not offer clinically useful information in the treatment of SSNHL. Also, because of the lower titers of TNF-alpha documented in patients with SSNHL, we do not recommend the use of specific TNF-alpha inhibitors in SSNHL.
