ELISA subtypization of anti-ENA autoantibodies in clinical management of autoimmune diseases in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The basis of autoimmune diseases such as SLE (Systemic Lupus Eritematodes), Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, dermatomyositis and polymiositis is the creation of auto-antibodies to the following specific extractable nuclear antigens (ENA):Jo-1, Ssl-70, SS-A, SS-B, Sm and Sm/RNPs. Some of these antigens are in fact enzymes (Jo-1-histidil-tRNA synthetase, Scl-70-topoisomerase) which are inhibited by specific autoantibodies--this leads to disturbance in the metabolism of DNA and protein biosynthesis. During 2009, we analyzed total of 87 serum samples of patients suspected for autoimmune disorder using ANA-IFA and ELISA-ENA-6 methods. After establishing IFA-ANA positivity (83.9%), all serum specimens; ANA positive and negative, were subtypized by ELISA ENA-6 test. Analysis showed the highest incidence of anti-SS-A (56%), and incidence of anti-SS-B (29.8%), anti-Sm/ RNP (11.5%), anti-Jo-1 (2.3%) and anti-Scl-70 (1,1%) auto-antibodies. Also, 78.5% of IFA-ANA negative serum specimens showed high level of positivity (212.50 and 277.0 IU/ml) to SS-A (78.5%) and SS-B (21.4%) antigenes using ELISA-ENA-6 subtypization. Following these results, we conclude that it is necessary to introduce Western blot confirmation testing. After comparing with other clinical findings, we diagnosed the following autoimmune diseases: SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and dermatomiosytis.
