Significantly higher frequencies of presence of serum autoantibodies in Chinese patients with oral lichen planus.BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown the presence of serum anti-nuclear (ANA), anti-smooth muscle (SMA), anti-mitochondrial (AMA), anti-gastric parietal cell (GPCA), anti-thyroglobulin (TGA) and anti-thyroid microsomal autoantibodies (TMA) in small groups of patients with oral lichen planus (OLP). METHODS: In this study, the serum levels of ANA, SMA, AMA, GPCA, TGA and TMA were measured in a group of 320 Chinese OLP patients and 53 healthy control subjects to assess whether Chinese OLP patients had significantly higher frequencies of serum autoantibodies than healthy control subjects and to assess which risk factors had a significant influence on the possession of a specific serum autoantibody in OLP patients. RESULTS: We found that autoantibodies were present in 195 (60.9%) of the 320 OLP patients. The frequencies of presence of serum ANA (28.1%), GPCA (26.3%), TGA (21.3%) and TMA (24.4%) in OLP patients were significantly higher than those (5.7%, 1.9%, 1.9% and 1.9%, respectively) in healthy control subjects (all P-values were &lt; 0.005). Forty-one (12.8%) OLP patients also had anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVA) in their sera. The multivariate logistic regression found that major erosive OLP (EOLP) [odds ratio (OR) = 1.786], TGA/TMA-positivity (OR = 2.517), and HCVA-positivity (OR = 2.214) were significant risk factors to influence ANA-positivity in OLP patients. Moreover, only major EOLP (OR = 1.879) and ANA-positivity (OR = 2.581) were significant risk factors to influence TGA/TMA-positivity in OLP patients. CONCLUSIONS: There are significantly higher frequencies of presence of ANA, GPCA, TGA and TMA in Chinese OLP patients than in healthy control subjects.
