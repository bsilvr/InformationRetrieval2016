Prognosis of neonates in pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus.PURPOSE: The effects of maternal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on neonatal prognosis were examined by comparing clinical features of full-term babies born to lupus mothers and age- and parity-matched controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2005, 39 singletons were born to 37 SLE women. Excluding 11 cases of prematurity and preeclampsia, 28 full-term neonates formed the lupus group. The control group included 66 full-term babies. The retrospective study examined medical records and compared gestational age, birth weight, days of hospital stay, small for gestational age (SGA) frequency, Apgar scores &lt; 7, and parity. Lupus neonates were tested for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and platelet count, and electrocardiogram was performed. RESULTS: Average gestational age (38 vs. 39 weeks, p &lt; 0.05) and birth weight (2,775 vs. 3,263g, p &lt; 0.05) were significantly different between the SLE and control groups. SGA frequency was higher in the SLE group (25% vs. 4.5%, p &lt; 0.05). No significant difference was observed in Apgar score, birth weight, gestational age, SGA frequency, and platelet count between lupus subgroups formed based on anti-dsDNA antibody levels and antiphospholipid antibody status. CONCLUSION: The association of maternal ANAs, antiphospholipid antibodies, and drug history with neonatal prognosis could not be elucidated. However, even in uncomplicated pregnancies, maternal lupus is disadvantageous for gestational age, birth weight, and SGA frequency.
