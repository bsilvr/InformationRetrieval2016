[Does interventional therapy prolong the patency of hemodialysis fistulas and grafts?]PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate procedural success and patency after endovascular treatment of acute dysfunctional hemodialysis fistulas and grafts in a non-preselected patient cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 185 angiographies of hemodialysis fistulas and grafts on the upper extremities were analyzed for 120 patients (53 male, 67 female; mean-age 63.1 +/- 11.4, range 24 - 91). 70 % (n = 130) were native arteriovenous fistulas, 17 % (n = 31) were prosthetic grafts, and 13 % (n = 24) were non-specific. In total, 278 lesions requiring endovascular treatment were detected. 13 % (n = 35) of the lesions were located in the arterial inflow, 18 % (n = 49) in native arteriovenous anastomoses, 7 % (n = 19) in prosthetic grafts and 62 % (n = 171) in the venous outflow. The primary, secondary and cumulative patency after endovascular treatment was calculated. RESULTS: In 51 % (n = 94) of the cases endovascular treatment could be performed, in 8 % (n = 14) no lesion requiring treatment was detected, and in 42 % (n = 77) intervention was not considered possible. In 45 % (n = 124) of the detected lesions endovascular treatment was successful, in 18 % (n = 51) the intervention failed, and in 37 % (n = 103) intervention was not considered possible. The complication rate was 5 % (n = 10). The primary, secondary, and cumulative patency rates for 50 % of the hemodialysis fistulas and grafts after endovascular treatment were 65, 191, and 370 days, respectively. The results differed significantly from each other with p &lt; 0.05 in the log rank test and log rank trend test. CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of acute dysfunctional hemodialysis fistulas and grafts is effective in restoring the patency for hemodialysis.
