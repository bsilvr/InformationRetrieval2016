[Personal experience with establishment of arteriovenous anastomoses for dialysis using blood vessels in the cubital fossa]The authors use, when establishing secondary arteriovenous anastomoses for haemodialysis, the blood vessels of the cubital fossa. If it is possible from the anatomical and functional aspect, they connect the superficial venous vessels to the arterial ones by means of a perforating vein. If the blood vessels of the forearm are of poor quality, they use this procedure as the primary approach. After two years the group of 38 established fistulas comprises 87% which can be completely used and none of them had to be modified.
