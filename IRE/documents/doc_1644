[Establishment of arteriovenous anastomoses with interposition of ePTFE (Goretex) prostheses]The authors remind of the possibility to establish an arteriovenous anastomosis by interposition of an ePTFE prosthesis into the subclavian to brachial artery with an outflow into the subclavian or internal jugular vein. The method is suitable for case when the autologous circulation is exhausted and calls for perfect peroperative evaluation of the vascular system of the patient with subsequent careful monitoring of the function of the anastomosis.
