Constriction of porcine arteriovenous anastomoses by indorenate is unrelated to 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C or 5-HT1D receptor subtypes.The study concerns the effects of indorenate, a tryptamine derivative with antihypertensive properties as well as high affinity for the 5-HT1A binding site, on carotid haemodynamics in anaesthetized pigs. Intracarotid infusions of indorenate (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 10 min each) caused dose-related decreases in total common carotid artery blood flow due almost exclusively to a reduction in arteriovenous anastomotic flow. These effects of indorenate were not appreciably modified after treatment with the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (0.5 mg.kg-1 i.a.), but were markedly reduced after treatment with methiothepin (1.0 mg.kg-1 i.a.), which antagonizes not only 5-HT2 receptors, but also the putative 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B 5-HT1C and 5-HT1D subtypes of 5-HT1-like receptors. Nonetheless, metergoline (1 mg.kg-1 i.a.), a drug with higher affinity than methiothepin for the above 5-HT1 receptor subtypes, failed to significantly modify the responses to indorenate. It is therefore concluded that, like 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole (RU 24969), indorenate reduces both total common carotid and cephalic arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow in the pig by stimulating 5-HT1-like receptors; these receptors, however, do not seem to correspond to either 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C or 5-HT1D binding sites.
