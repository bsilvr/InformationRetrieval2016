Cavernous vein arterialization for vasculogenic impotence. An animal model.We designed acute and chronic animal models to evaluate a new procedure of arterialization of the cavernous vein. In the acute study, arteriogenic impotence was induced in 6 dogs by bilateral ligation of the penile arteries just proximal to the crus of the penis. The cavernous vein and penile artery were anastomosed proximal to the site of ligation, and the pudendal vein was ligated proximally to prevent the diversion of arterial blood away from the penis. Erection was induced either by electrostimulation of the cavernous nerves or by intracavernous injection of papaverine, and the erectile response was studied before and after cavernous vein arterialization. Four dogs were followed up for two months to evaluate the long-term effects of the procedure. Shortly after arterialization of the cavernous vein, the basal flow rate in the internal pudendal artery increased dramatically to almost six times the control rate, and the erectile response to neurostimulation was approximately 85 percent of control. Selective pudendal arteriography at two months confirmed the patency of all arteriovenous anastomoses. However, scanning electron microscopy and histologic examination revealed sinusoidal damage most probably consequent to the chronically elevated arterial flow.
