[Arteriovenous anastomoses in the treatment of postphlebitic syndrome of the lower extremities]The authors describe an original method of putting arteriovenous end-to-end anastomosis between the distal fragment of the artery and central fragment of the vein in postphlebitic + syndrome of lower extremities. Operations were performed on 27 patients with different forms of the syndrome. Clinical improvement was obtained in 22 patients (81%), which was confirmed by findings of functional investigations. This operation was most effective in patients with recanalization or partly recanalized forms of the postphlebitic syndrome.
