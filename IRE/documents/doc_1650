[Artificial arteriovenous anastomoses in reconstructive surgery of arteries with a poor distal vascular bed]Based on their experience with the operative treatment of 20 patients with acute thrombosis of major arteries of extremities the authors recommend if indicated to combine reconstructive operation on the arteries with the artificial arterio-venous anastomosis. The authors have developed a classification of such associated operations which facilitates choice of their variants dependent on the state of the distal vascular bed.
