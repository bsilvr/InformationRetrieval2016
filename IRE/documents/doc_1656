Experience with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in patients on long-term hemodialysis.Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a new material now being used to create subcutaneous arteriovenous anastomoses for vascular access in hemodialysis. The authors have been impressed with the versatility of grafts made from this material and, where failure occurs, the ease with which surgical revision can be carried out. Two cases are described to illustrate the adaptability of this material to reconstruction. The authors' initial impression based on 22 months' experience is that PTFE grafts have appreciably modified the management with respect to vascular access, of many patients on long-term hemodialysis.
