[Causes of failure in surgical arteriovenous anastomoses]The causes of failure in surgical arteriovenous anastomoses are discussed with reference to 60 operations performed on 52 patients suffering from chronic renal insufficiency in the uremic stage. The various technical variants applied are shown, as well as the early and late complications and the order in which reinterventions were performed. The work concludes with an original mathematical study of the blood output in the three fistula variants practiced by the authors, designed to supply evidence of their functional value.
