Alexis Carrel: genius, innovator and ideologist.Alexis Carrel was a Frenchman from Lyon, who gained fame at the Rockefeller Institute in New York at the beginning of the 20th century. He was the first to demonstrate that arteriovenous anastomoses were possible. Alexis Carrel was awarded the Nobel Prize for his contributions to vascular surgery and transplantation in 1912. He was a versatile scientist, who made numerous discoveries from the design of an antiseptic solution to treat injuries during the First World War to tissue culture and engineering, and organ preservation, making him the father of solid organ transplantation. Together, with the famous aviator and engineer Charles Lindbergh, they were the first scientists capable of keeping an entire organ alive outside of the body, using a perfusion machine. Due to his many dubious ideas and his association with fascism in the 1930s and during the Second World War, many of his scientific achievements have been forgotten today and taken for granted.
