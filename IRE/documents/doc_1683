The vascular bed in the rabbit ear: microangiography and scanning electron microscopy of vascular corrosion casts.The vascular bed of the rabbit ear has been studied with light microscopy, microangiography and scanning electron microscopy of resin casts in a series of 20 ears. The major arteries supplying the ear were the central and rostral auricular branches of the caudal auricular artery. The caudal auricular branch was not observed, except as a small vessel supplying the rostral auricular base. The central auricular branch supplied blood to most of the auricular integument and was surrounded by capillaries extended from those supplying the skin. The periarterial capillaries formed a fine, compact network in the tunica media and were closely related to the central auricular branch. Evidence is presented suggesting that this vascular mechanism has a counter-current heat-exchange function for regulating body temperature. The artery had the well-developed internal elastic lamina and intimal cushions that regulate blood flow at the branching sites. A number of arteriovenous anastomoses were also observed between arterioles and venules, particularly in marginal regions of the ear. The intimal cushions and arteriovenous anastomoses might play an additional role in thermoregulation by regulating local blood flow in the ear.
