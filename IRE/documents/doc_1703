Recurrent unilateral frosted branch angiitis.In the left eye of a 27-year-old man we found perivascular creamy sheathing of retinal veins with retinal hemorrhages and, on fluorescein angiography, delayed filling of veins with late leakage. Dramatic recovery of visual acuity and healing of retinal lesions followed intravenous corticosteroid therapy. However, the condition recurred several times within a few months. Fluorescein angiography showed delayed filling of arteries and veins and arteriovenous anastomoses with a widespread capillary nonperfusion area. Eventually, neovascular glaucoma resulted. It is suggested that frosted branch angiitis is related to vascular occlusion. Systemic corticosteroid therapy seems to affect the course of this disease.
