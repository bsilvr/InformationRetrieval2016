Control of arteriovenous anastomoses in rabbit ear model of digital perfusion.The arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA) of the cutaneous microcirculation of the hands and feet are fundamental determinants of thermoregulatory blood flow and may be involved in cold intolerance. These direct microvascular studies are an initial characterization of adrenergic receptor subtypes participating in control of AVA in the ears of anesthetized male New Zealand White rabbits. Adrenergic alpha 1-stimulation with phenylephrine produced AVA constriction, whereas terazosin (an alpha 1-antagonist) produced dilation and attenuated the responses to phenylephrine. Adrenergic alpha 2-stimulation with UK-14304 produced constriction of the AVA, whereas atipamezole (an alpha 2-antagonist) produced dilation and attenuated the responses to UK-14304. When equimolar concentrations of antagonists were studied, the AVA dilation produced by alpha 2-blockade was greater than that produced by alpha 1-blockade. Norepinephrine (a mixed alpha 1- and alpha 2-agonist) also produced vasoconstriction, which was attenuated by both prazosin (an alpha 1-antagonist) and atipamezole. In summary, 1) AVA contain a heterogeneous mixture of both alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors, and 2) alpha 2-receptors may have a greater influence than alpha 1-receptors on overall tone in AVA.
