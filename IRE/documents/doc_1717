Heat-washout: a new method for measuring cutaneous blood flow rate in areas with and without arteriovenous anastomoses.A new method, the heat-washout method, for measuring total cutaneous blood flow rate is introduced. The measurements were performed with a transcutaneous (tc) PO2-electrode that is capable of heating and measuring local temperature, and it is constructed with a thermostatically controlled cap. The probe was heated electrically to a selected temperature 2-10 degrees above normal skin temperature. When the temperature was stable, the heating element was turned off, and the temperature was registered every 10 s until a stable baseline temperature, Tb, was obtained. Tb was subtracted from the registered temperatures giving deltaTs that were plotted in a semilogarithmic diagram. The heat-washout was monoexponential, and the slope was used for calculating blood flow rate in accordance with the principle of Kety, using a known partition coefficient. The method was applied to the forearm in two subjects, and the results were compared to blood flow rates obtained simultaneously by the 133Xe-washout method in the same area. The equation of the regression line was y = 2.5 + 0 x 968X and the correlation coefficient was 0 x 986 at temperature levels of 37-45 degrees C. In the pulp of the thumb, blood flow rates, in arteriovenous anastomoses, were estimated in two subjects by subtracting the capillary blood flow rate, measured by 133Xe-washout, from the total cutaneous blood flow rate, measured by heat-washout. Due to a relatively low diffusions coefficient for 133Xe compared to heat, 133Xe cannot be used for measurement of blood flow rate in arteriovenous anastomoses.
