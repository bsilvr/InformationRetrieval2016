A causal relationship between fluctuations in thermoregulatory skin perfusion and respiratory movements in man.The relationship between regular respiration with normal tidal volume and spontaneous fluctuations in blood flow through skin arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) was investigated. Laser Doppler measurements from skin areas known to contain arteriovenous anastomoses, ultrasound Doppler measurements from the radial artery and respiratory movements were recorded simultaneously in 7 supine human subjects in a thermoneutral environment. The phase relationship between respiration and the onset of sudden arteriovenous anastomoses vasoconstrictions was calculated in each subject. A few seconds before a vasoconstriction, there was a clear tendency towards synchrony in the respiration recordings, indicating that some respiration-phase-dependent event precedes the vasoconstrictions. Since arteriovenous anastomoses constrictions are accompanied by specific changes in heart rate and blood pressure, our findings link respiration to low-frequency heart rate and blood-pressure variability in humans.
