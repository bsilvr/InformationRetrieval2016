Connection between skin arteriovenous shunt flow fluctuations and heart rate variability in infants.Large, spontaneous fluctuations in blood flow to acral skin, caused by synchronous opening and closing of arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs), have been demonstrated in adults in a thermoneutral environment. Individual AVA constrictions were accompanied by a diphasic heart rate (HR) response, indicating the presence of an autonomic rhythm which affected both skin AVA activity and heart rate variability. In the present study, 24 neonates were examined on day 2 (range 1-3 days) and re-examined at 14 weeks (11-17 weeks). The presence of rhythmic, synchronous fluctuations in laser Doppler flux in the palm of the hand and sole of the foot in 20 of 24 neonates strongly indicated the presence of functional skin AVA at birth. Both neonates and 3-month-old infants showed a diphasic HR response in association with cutaneous AVA constrictions. The infant response differed from the adult response mainly by the longer duration of the secondary bradycardia. This may reflect different properties of the baroreceptor reflex in infants and adults.
