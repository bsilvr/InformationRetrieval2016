On the preservation and regulation of vascular tone in arteriovenous anastomoses during anesthesia.In conscious pigs, arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) are in a constricted state so that &lt; 5% of intra-atrially injected radioactive (15-microns-diam) microspheres are shunted to the lungs. Many of the anesthetic regimens frequently used in cardiovascular research dilate AVAs, thereby greatly increasing the percentage of microspheres reaching the lungs. This may seriously limit extrapolation of results obtained under anesthesia to the conscious state. We now describe that anesthesia with a combination of fentanyl and thiopental preserves the tone of AVAs, maintaining shunting under 4% of cardiac output. Furthermore, we studied in the carotid circulation of this model whether norepinephrine or 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT), both contained in perivascular nerves, is responsible for this tone. Consecutive antagonism of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, 5-HT1, and 5-HT2 receptors was obtained by sequential injection of prazosin, phentolamine, ketanserin, and methiothepin. Prazosin increased AVA blood flow, partly at the expense of extracerebral tissue blood flow, but preserved cerebral blood flow. None of the other antagonists had any additional significant effect. Therefore, in this model the tone in AVAs seems to be maintained by sympathetic norepinephrine-containing nerves via alpha 1-adrenoceptors.
