Innervation of the arteriovenous anastomoses in the dog tongue.Profiles of nerve plexuses in the arteriovenous anastomoses of the dog tongue were investigated by both transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Three-dimensional morphology of the vascular nerves was examined after removal of the connective tissue components by the HCl-hydrolysis method. Tight bending and a rich nerve supply were the most characteristic features of the anastomosing channels. The tunica media consisted of an outer circular layer of typical smooth-muscle cells and an inner region containing longitudinal plicae of ramified smooth-muscle cells. The tunica adventitia was exclusively occupied by nerve bundles; fibroblasts were poorly developed. Numerous nerve bundles of variable size were coiled around the anastomosing channels, and occasional bundles ran crosswise over the U-shaped bent vessels.
