The selective closure of feline carotid arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) by GR43175.The haemodynamic effects of the selective 5-HT1-like agonist GR43175 have been compared with that of ergotamine in anaesthetized cats. Both GR43175 (30-1000 micrograms/kg intravenously) and ergotamine (0.3-30 micrograms/kg intravenously) caused a dose-dependent reduction in the proportion of cardiac output passing through arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs). However, unlike GR43175, the effect of ergotamine (30 micrograms/kg intravenously) was associated with marked increases in diastolic blood pressure and total peripheral resistance. In further studies, the effect of GR43175 on the distribution of blood flow within the carotid bed has been examined. GR43175 caused a reduction in total carotid arterial blood flow which was entirely due to a reduction in flow through carotid AVAs. These results demonstrate that GR43175, unlike ergotamine, has a highly selective vasoconstrictor action on AVAs within the cranial circulation of anaesthetized cats. Such a mechanism may be important in its antimigraine activity.
