Wall structure of arteriovenous anastomoses in the rabbit ear. Combined light-, scanning- and transmission electron-microscopic studies.The wall structure of arteriovenous anastomoses in the rabbit ear was investigated. (1) Clusters of epithelioid smooth muscle cells form 3-4 longitudinally oriented plicae. The channel shows a single, irregularly outlined lumen, and its wall is very thin between adjacent plicae. (2) Endothelial cells covering the plicae protrude into the lumen, thus suggesting active contraction or shortening of the plicae. (3) The tunica adventitia is composed of 4-6 sheaths of flat fibroblasts, which may serve as a barrier to prevent loss of neurotransmitters. Processes of some of the fibroblasts also extend into the tunica media. (4) The tunica media is composed of an outer circular layer of typical smooth muscle cells, and an inner longitudinally running plica of ramified smooth muscle cells. Wide intercellular spaces between these ramified cells are filled with collagen fibrils, microfibrils, amorphous intercellular substances, and fibroblasts. Fibroblasts form close membrane contacts with each other, and with the smooth muscle cells. (5) Fibroblasts and other connective tissue components may function as an elastic support during active motility of the anastomotic channel.
