Innervation of arteriovenous anastomoses in the brood patch of the domestic fowl.The innervation of blood vessels in the brood patch (thoracic skin) of the domestic fowl was studied by use of the catecholamine fluorescence technique, acetylcholinesterase staining, and the immunoperoxidase technique for demonstration of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Large arteries and veins were sparsely innervated, whereas arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) were densely innervated by adrenergic, acetylcholinesterase-positive, and VIP-immunoreactive nerve fibres. The rich supply of different vasomotor nerves to AVAs emphasizes the importance of these vascular shunts in regulating blood flow and, in turn, the transport of heat to the brood patch. Furthermore, the presence of VIP-immunoreactive nerve fibres in the vasculature of the brood patch suggests that VIP might be the mediator of the previously reported cold-induced vasodilatation.
