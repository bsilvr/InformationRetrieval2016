Innervation of arteriovenous anastomoses in the sheep tongue: immunocytochemical evidence for coexistence of neural transmitters.In this study structural and immunocytochemical evidence has shown that arterial vessels, particularly AVAs, are associated with nerves containing peptidergic vasodilators, viz. VIP, CGRP and SP. The presence of VIP-like immunoreactivity in both P-type and C-type nerves is evidence of the coexistence of VIP and acetylcholine in cholinergic nerves and suggests the action of VIP in maintaining the opening of AVAs in heat stress conditions. The evidence for the co-existence of CGRP and SP is more direct as immunoreactivity for both peptides has been demonstrated in serial sections of the same nerve terminal. Although SP is a potent vasodilator there is little evidence of its role in thermoregulation; however it may be involved in a local axon reflex and cause antidromic vasodilatation of local vessels particularly AVAs.
