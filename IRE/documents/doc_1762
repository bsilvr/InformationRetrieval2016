Three-dimensional SEM study of arteriovenous anastomoses in the dog's tongue using corrosive resin casts.Arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) participate in the regulation of blood flow. Although it has been speculated that AVAs in the dog's tongue play a role in the regulation of the body temperature, no published work is available on the structural characteristics of AVAs in the dog's tongue. The purpose of the present investigation was therefore to determine the frequency of AVAs and their structural characteristics by the fabrication of vascular corrosive resin casts and examination under a scanning electron microscope. This method permitted not only the visualization of the three-dimensional characteristics of AVAs, but also a clear differentiation between arterioles and venules. The total number of AVAs in the mucosal lamina propria of the dorsum of the left tongue half was 2,292. Several essential types such as S-shaped, hook-shaped, straight, bibranching and Y-shaped AVAs were observed, of which the S-shaped and similar types constituted the overwhelming majority; Y-shaped types have never been reported heretofore. This study also revealed that the locations where AVAs were most often distributed were, in descending order of frequency, the tip, the corpus and the root area of the tongue. This high frequency and strategic location of AVAs in the tongue strongly indicate that AVAs of the dog's tongue participate in the thermal regulation.
