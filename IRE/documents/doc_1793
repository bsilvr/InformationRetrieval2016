[Fractures of the ankle joint and the astragalus. New aspects in diagnosis and treatment (author's transl)]Five separate problems are discussed: additional lesions of the ankle joint in lower-leg fractures; posterior plate fixation of short oblique distal fibula fracture; reversed lag-screw fixation of small avulsed fragment of the medial malleolus; reduction of smaller posterior tibia lip fragment through the lateral malleolus; primary tibiotalar fusion in the most severe astragalar fractures.
