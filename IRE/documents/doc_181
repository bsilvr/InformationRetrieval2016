Orientation toward spirituality and self-help approaches in the therapeutic community.Although Alcoholics Anonymous and other Twelve-Step interventions are among the most widely utilized self-help options by persons with chemical dependency, little is known concerning whether this approach should be integrated with non-spirituality based self-help approaches. The purpose of this study was to assess the extent to which clients receiving inpatient treatment in a residential therapeutic community (TC) felt that spirituality based interventions should be featured in TC treatment. Three hundred twenty-two members of the Daytop TC completed a survey assessing personal orientation to spirituality and attitudes towards spirituality based treatments. The majority of clients believed that the TC program should feature spirituality more in treatment. Nearly half agreed that the Twelve-Step (AA) approach should be more a part of TC treatment. Preference for Twelve-Step meeting interventions was positively correlated with past attendance at Twelve-Step meetings. Personal spiritual orientation to life was positively correlated with endorsement of spirituality based interventions in TC treatment. These findings highlight the importance of integrating treatment approaches which address the spiritual needs of TC residents.
