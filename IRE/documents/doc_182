A factor analytic study of influences on patterns of help-seeking among treated and untreated alcohol dependent persons.Influences on seeking help from professional alcohol treatment and from Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) were investigated using problem drinkers (N = 167) with different help-seeking experiences (no assistance, AA only, or treatment plus AA) and current drinking statuses (sustained abstinence for &gt; 2 years or active problem drinking). Depending on their help-seeking experiences, participants rated barriers to or reasons for seeking help from treatment and AA, which were factor analyzed. Common impediments to help-seeking included privacy concerns and participants' beliefs that they could solve their problem on their own and that it was not serious enough to seek help. Common reasons for help-seeking included social and other functional problems related to drinking. There were also influences unique to treatment (e.g., cost) and to AA (e.g., group format). Help-seeking factors did not vary by drinking status. The implications for increasing help-seeking among problem drinkers are discussed.
