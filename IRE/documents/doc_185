Different variables are associated with help-seeking patterns and long-term outcomes among problem drinkers.This study investigated variables associated with help-seeking for drinking problems and with long-term drinking outcomes. In a 3 x 2 design, problem drinkers (N=167) were selected according to their help-seeking history [no assistance (NA), Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) only, or treatment plus AA (TxAA)] and current drinking status [resolved abstinent (RA) for &gt;2 years or non-resolved (NR) active drinkers]. Drinking practices and problems, influences on help-seeking, and life events were assessed retrospectively during structured interviews. Participant reports were verified through collateral or reliability interviews. Stable resolution was associated with heavier drinking and greater negative life events before resolution. Seeking help, especially from treatment, was associated with greater psychosocial problems and higher dependence levels. The results indicate that different dimensions of drinking problems are associated with help-seeking and drinking outcomes, and suggest ways to increase help-seeking.
