[Culture-filtrate producing condition and biological activity of Fusarium solani]OBJECTIVE: To study the culture-filtrate producing condition of Fusarium Solani isolated from Astragalus root and explore the mechanism Astragalus root rot disease caused by, in order to find theoretical support for screening resistant germ plasma via mycotoxin. METHOD: The method of germinating seeds in petri dish with filter paper and inhibition method for embryo growth were used to study the biological activity and the specialty of cultural filtrate of 10 F. solani isolates. RESULT: The toxin produced by F. solani had strong inhibition effect in the different nutrient media, at different temperatures and under different light conditions. With extension of culturing time, embryo inhibition rate went up gradually with the strongest inhibition at the 12th day and the inhibition ratio between 92.0% -52.0%. The toxin produced at 5 degrees C to 35 degrees C inhibited embryo germination of Astragalus differently with the strongest at 25 degrees C, and next to it at 20,30 degrees C. The impact of light on bioactive substances of the toxin was not statistically distinctive, but the 24-hour darkness was benefit to toxin production. PSC had a stronger inhibition rate than the other nutrient media, next to it was PDB. After autoclaving, the toxin still kept toxic to embryo of Astragalus, which indicated that the toxin was tolerant to high temperatures. CONCLUSION: The toxin produced by F. solani at different growing condition had strong biological activity, was tolerant to high temperature. The best condition for F. solani to produce toxin was that it was cultured in PSC liquid medium, in dark, at 25 degrees C for 12 d. The toxin produced by isolate HQM40 was non-host specific toxin.
