[Establishment of transgenic receptor system and aFGF transformation in astragalus]OBJECTIVE: To establish a high-frequency regeneration system of Astragalus and an aFGF transformation system. METHOD: Cotyledon node of the Astragalus explants was used for organogenesis to establish a high-frequency regeneration system. GV3101 was used to transform cotyledon node, and aFGF gene was introduced into Astragalus, renewable strain was detected by PCR. RESULT: All cotyledon node was explants, adventitious buds were induced in the medium of MS +2.0 mg x L(-1) BA +0.5 mg x L(-1) IBA, the root was taken in the medium of 1/2MS +5.0 mg x L(-1) NAA to give a high frequency regeneration system. All cotyledon node was precultured in medium for 3 days and infected with Agrobacterium (A600 0.3) for 10 min and then cocultured for 2 days. The aFGF gene was confirmed to transform into genome of Astragalus. CONCLUSION: A high-frequency regeneration system of Astragalus and an aFGF transformation system were established.
