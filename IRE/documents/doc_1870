Inhibitory effect of emodin and Astragalus polysaccharide on the replication of HBV.AIM: To evaluate the anti-viral effect of emodin plus Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) in hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mice. METHODS: Sixty HBV transgenic mice (HBV TGM) whose weight varied between 18 and 24 g were randomly divided into 3 groups, with 20 mice in each group. Group A was the normal control, where the mice were treated with physiological saline; group B was the positive control where the mice were treated with lamivudine solution (100 mL/kg per day). Group C was the experimental group where the mice were treated with physiological saline containing emodin and APS (57.59 mg/kg per day and 287.95 mg/kg per day, respectively). The mice were treated daily for 3 wk. After 1 wk recovery time, the mice were sacrificed and serum as well as liver tissues were collected for ELISA and histological examination. RESULTS: After 21 d treatment, HBV DNA levels in group B and group C significantly declined when compared with group A (P &lt; 0.05). However, a significant increase in HBV DNA content was observed in group B, whereas this phenomenon was not observed in group C. A reduction in the contents of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBcAg in the mice from group B and C was observed when compared with group A. CONCLUSION: Emodin and APS have a weak but persistent inhibitory effect on HBV replication in vivo, which may function as a supplementary modality in the treatment of hepatitis B infection.
