Organoselenides from Nicotiana tabacum genetically modified to accumulate selenium.Nicotiana tabacum L. (tobacco) plants were transformed to overexpress a selenocysteine methyltransferase gene from the selenium hyperaccumulator Astragalus bisulcatus (Hook.) A. Gray (two-grooved milkvetch), and an ATP-sulfurylase gene from Brassica oleracea L. var. italica (broccoli). Solvent extraction of leaves harvested from plants treated with selenate revealed five selenium-containing compounds, of which four were identified by chemical synthesis as 2-(methylseleno)acetaldehyde, 2,2-bis(methylseleno)acetaldehyde, 4-(methylseleno)-(2E)-nonenal, and 4-(methylseleno)-(2E,6Z)-nonadienal. These four compounds have not previously been reported in nature.
