Cycloartane-type glycosides from two species of Astragalus (Fabaceae).Three known cycloartane-type glycosides were isolated from the roots of two different species of Astragalus, A. glycyphyllos, A. sempervirens. The identification of these compounds were mainly achieved by 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques and FAB-MS. The results of our studies confirm that triterpene saponins from the cycloartane-type skeleton might be chemotaxonomically significant to the genus Astragalus.
