Protection of PC12 cells against superoxide-induced damage by isoflavonoids from Astragalus mongholicus.OBJECTIVE: To further investigate the neuroprotective effects of five isoflavonoids from Astragalus mongholicus on xanthine (XA)/ xanthine oxidase (XO)-induced injury to PC12 cells. METHODS: PC12 cells were damaged by XA/XO. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, MTT, LDH, and GSH assays were used to evaluate the protection of these five isoflavonoids. Contents of Bcl-2 family proteins were determined with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Among the five isoflavonoids including formononetin, ononin, 9, 10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-beta-D-glucoside, calycosin and calycosin-7-O-glucoside, calycosin and calycosin-7-O-glucoside were found to inhibit XA/ XO-induced injury to PC12 cells. Their EC50 values of formononetin and calycosin were 0.05 microg/mL. Moreover, treatment with these three isoflavonoids prevented a decrease in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), while formononetin and calycosin could prevent a significant deletion of GSH. In addition, only calycosin and calycosin-7-O-glucoside were shown to inhibit XO activity in cell-free system, with an approximate IC50 value of 10 microg/mL and 50 microg/mL. Formononetin and calycosin had no significant influence on Bcl-2 or Bax protein contents. CONCLUSION: Neuroprotection of formononetin, calycosin and calycosin-7-O-glucoside may be mediated by increasing endogenous antioxidants, rather by inhibiting XO activities or by scavenging free radicals.
