[Study on genetic relationship of Astragalus membranaceus var mongholicus in different producing area using SRAP]OBJECTIVE: To study the genetic relationship of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus in different producing area and provide theoretical basis for the evaluation of Astragalus germplasm resources. METHOD: Through quence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) analysis, the systematic diagram of genetic relationship was constructed by UPGMA method. RESULT: A total of 141 SRAP markers were scored. By the use of UPGMA cluster analysis with genetic distance, Astragalus could be divided into two provenance plots of Gansu and Shanxi. CONCLUSION: The genetic differentiation among populations of A. membranaceus var. mongholicus is remarkable. SRAP marker could be efficiently used for the study of the genetic relationship of Astragalus.
