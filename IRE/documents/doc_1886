Astragalus mongholicus ameliorates renal fibrosis by modulating HGF and TGF-beta in rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction.Astragalus mongholicus (AM) derived from the dry root of Astragalus membranaceus Bge. var. mongolicus (Bge.) Hsiao is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine. The present study investigated the potential role of AM on renal fibrosis on a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). We divided 48 Sprague-Dawley rats randomly into 4 groups: sham-operated group (Sham), untreated UUO group, AM-treated (10 g/(kg x d)) UUO group, and losartan-treated (20 mg/(kg x d)) UUO group as positive control. Haematoxylin &amp; eosin (HE) and Masson staining were used to study the dynamic histological changes of the kidneys 7 and 14 d after operation. The expressions of fibronectin (FN), type I collagen (colI), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry staining, and Western blot. Results show that, similar to losartan, AM alleviated the renal damage and decreased the deposition of FN and colI from UUO by reducing the expressions of TGF-beta1 and alpha-SMA (P&lt;0.05), whereas HGF increased greatly with AM treatment (P&lt;0.05). Our findings reveal that AM could retard the progression of renal fibrosis. The renoprotective effect of AM might be related to inhibition of myofibroblast activation, inducing of HGF and reducing of TGF-beta1 expression.
