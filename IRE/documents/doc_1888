Protective effects of astragaloside IV on porcine-serum-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats and in vitro effects on hepatic stellate cells.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Astragaloside IV is the primary pure saponin isolated from Astragalus membranaceus, one of the valuable traditional medical herbs. Antifibrotic activities of Astragalus membranaceus have been extensively proved. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effects of astragaloside IV on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and hepatic fibrosis in rats induced by porcine-serum (PS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liver fibrosis was induced by PS injection (0.5 ml, twice a week) for 12 weeks. Astragaloside IV (2.0, 4.0 mg kg(-1)) was administered intragastrically. Liver samples were subjected to histological and immunohistochemical studies. In vitro effects of astragaloside IV on primary cultured HSCs were detected by incorporation assays. RESULTS: Astragaloside IV delayed the formation of liver fibrosis and decrease the serum levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), procollagen type III (PCIII) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in liver. The levels of transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) in serum and expression in liver were significantly decreased by astragaloside IV. Collagen synthesis and proliferation were significantly inhibited by astragaloside IV (1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 12.0 and 24.0 mg L(-1)) in HSCs. CONCLUSION: The results showed that astragaloside IV displays antifibrotic effects in rats induced by PS, the mechanism by which might be associated with its inhibitory effects on collagen synthesis and proliferation in HSCs.
