Antiproliferation and apoptosis of human tumor cell lines by a lectin (AMML) of Astragalus mongholicus.A lectin (AMML) from the roots of Astragalus mongholicus was extracted and purified by affinity chromatographic technique. Human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa), human osteoblast-like cell line (MG63) and human leukemia cell line (K562) were used to check the effects of AMML on cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle. Maximum growth inhibition (92%) was observed with HeLa cells, followed by K562 cells (84%) and MG63 (48%) cells. Morphological observation showed that AMML-treated HeLa cells displayed outstanding apoptosis characteristics, such as nuclear fragmentation and appearance of membrane-enclosed apoptotic bodies. The apoptosis of HeLa cells was confirmed by flow cytometry using Annexin V/FITC and propidium iodide (PI) staining technique. For the first time we also report a significant cell cycle arrest at S phase of HeLa cells by AMML. Therefore, the present investigation may lead to the possible therapeutic use of Astragalus mongholicus lectin.
