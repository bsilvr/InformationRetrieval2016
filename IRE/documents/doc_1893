Flavone and flavonol glycosides from Astragalus eremophilus and Astragalus vogelii.Two new rhamnocitrin glycosides (1 and 2) were isolated from the aerial parts of Astragalus vogelii, along with one known rhamnocitrin glycoside (3). Two known flavonol glycosides (4 and 5) and four known flavone derivatives (6-9) were isolated from the aerial parts of Astragalus eremophilus. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods including 1D- (1H, 13C and TOCSY) and 2D-NMR (DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMBC) experiments, as well as ESIMS analysis.
