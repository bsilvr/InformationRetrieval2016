BacA is indispensable for successful Mesorhizobium-Astragalus symbiosis.A homologue of Sinorhizobium meliloti bacA was isolated from Mesorhizobium huakuii 7653R, which is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen in symbiotic association with leguminous Astragalus sinicus (Chinese milk vetch). Inactivation of the bacA gene abolished the ability of M. huakuii 7653R to establish a successful symbiosis with its host plant. Simultaneously, compared with wild-type M. huakuii 7653R, the bacA mutant was more sensitive to cell envelope-disrupting agents (acidic solution, ethanol, SDS, and crystal violet). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the very-long-chain fatty acid (27-OHC-28:0 and 29-OHC-30:0) contents of lipid A was reduced in the M. huakuii 7653R bacA mutant. Taken together, our data suggest that the cell envelope was altered in the M. huakuii 7653R bacA mutant, which might deteriorate bacterial adaption to acute environmental changes encountered in host cells and ultimately result in the failure of Mesorhizobium-legume symbiosis.
