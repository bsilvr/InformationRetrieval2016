Synthesis and fluorescence properties of Eu-anthracene-9-carboxylic acid towards N-acetyl amino acids and nucleotides in different solvents.Europium (III) complex with anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9-AA) has been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, and TG-DTG techniques. The results indicated that the composition of this complex is Eu (9-AA)(3). The luminescence properties of the complex in different solvents and at different pH values have been investigated. The results show that the complex exhibits more efficient luminescence in THF and ethyl acetate. The interactions of Eu-complex with different N-acetyl amino acids and nucleotides in different solvents have been investigated by fluorescence measurements. Enhancement of the fluorescence intensities has been observed in cyclohexane, acetone, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran whereas the fluorescence intensities of the investigated complex in ethanol, water, and ethyl acetate exhibit relatively low intensity.
