Nutritional study on Embellisia astragali, a fungal pathogen of milk vetch (Astragalus adsurgens).Embellisia astragali is a strong, virulent pathogen that develops within milk vetch (Astragalus adsurgens). In order to determine nutrient requirements, the fungus was cultured on 9 carbon sources, 9 nitrogen sources, and 13 growth media in the dark at 25 degrees C. Growth rates and sporulation capacity were measured after 4 and 12 weeks. All carbon sources supported growth, but only soluble starch, inulin, and dextrose supported sporulation. In general, better growth was obtained on disaccharides and polysaccharides than on monosaccharides. Compared with no growth on NH(4) (+)-N and urea, the fungus grew little on all NO(3) (-)-N, amino-N, and other organic-N such as peptone. There was no sporulation or very sparse conidia on almost all nitrogen sources with supplied dextrose or soluble starch as sole carbon source. The better growth and sporulation on most of the semidefined media than on defined media indicates that some components in plant or animal material may be vital to the fungus. Sporulation was positively correlated with growth rate in N source experiment at 12 weeks and in growth media experiment at 4 and 12 weeks. The fungus favors grow within agar with growth rate less than 1.18 mm day(-1).
