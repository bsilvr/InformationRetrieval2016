[Astragalus protects the testis following testicular torsion/detorsion in rats]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effect of astragalus on testis tissues following unilateral testicular torsion/detorsion. METHODS: Thirty healthy adult Wistar rats were equally randomized into Group A (sham-operation control), B (torsion/detorsion) and C (torsion/detorsion plus intraperitoneal injection of astragalus). The testicular torsion/detorsion model was established by the Turner method. All the rats were fed under the same condition for 7 days and sacrificed, and the torsional testes were harvested for the detection of germ cell apoptosis, glutathione activity and the level of malonic diethylaldehyde (MDA). RESULTS: The apoptosis indexes (AI) of spermatogenic cells in the torsional testes were (5.82 +/- 1.21), (36.18 +/- 8.40) and (20.39 +/- 3.57) in Group A, B and C, significantly higher in Group B and C than in A (P &lt; 0.05) and in Group B than in C (P &lt; 0.05). Significant differences were observed in glutathione activity in the ipsilateral testes among Group A (48.03 +/- 2.01), B (30.93 +/- 1.25), C (38.44 +/- 1.06) U/mg (P&lt; 0.05), as well as in the level of MDA, (1.43 +/- 0.17), (3.98 +/- 0.36), (2.57 +/- 0.53) nmol/ml, among the three groups (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Astragalus could significantly reduce the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells, decrease the level of lipid peroxidation and protect glutathione activity in the torsional testis.
