[Immunoregulatory activity of polysaccharopeptide and Astragalus polysaccharides on EAC tumor-bearing mice]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immunoregulatory activities of polysaccharopeptide and astragalus polysaccharides on EAC tumor-bearing mice. METHOD: Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC) Kunming (KM) mice were used to establish the animal model for solid tumor. Mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 10): NS group (NS, 10 mL x kg(-1) x d(-1)), AMD group (AMD, 4 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), 0.2 mL, only for the first 3 days), PSP group (PSP, 250 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), 0.2 mL), APS group (APS, 250 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), 0.2 mL), complex prescription group (PSP + APS, 250 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), 0.1 mL) and combined treat group (AMD + PSP + APS, same dosage as above). After thirty days of treatment, immunocytochemical method was employed to detect the changes of T-lymphocyte subsets in the PBMC of tumor-bearing mice. Subsequently, the organ indexes and tumor inhibition rate were calculated and compared with those of control group. RESULT: Percentage of CD3+, CD4+ T-cell and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ were obviously prominence in the PSP and PSP + APS groups compared with those of NS group (0.05), percentage of CD8+ T-cell was significantly decreased compared with that of AMD group; percentage of CD3+, CD4+ T-cell were obviously increased in AMD + PSP + APS group relative to that of AMD group; the thymus index of AMD group was significantly decreased compared with that of NS group, but the thymus index of AMD + PSP + APS group was obviously increased compared with that of AMD group; the weight of tumor in each administration group was significantly decreased compared with that of NS group. CONCLUSION: PSP and PSP + APS complex prescription showed the remarkable immunoregulation on EAC mice with chemotherapy or not.
