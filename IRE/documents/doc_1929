[Effect of Astragalus mongholicus on renal gene expression profile in mice with diabetic nephropathy]OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Astragalus mongholicus on renal gene expression profile in mice with diabetic nephropathy by cDNA microarray. METHOD: The mice with diabetic nephropathy were fed A. mongholicus and normal saline respectively. cDNA microarray was used to measure gene expression profile in renal tissue after 12 weeks, and the data were analyzed by bioinformatics. RT-PCR was performed to detect the relative levels of some genes which were randomly selected. RESULT: Eighty eight genes were found differently expressed in two chips. Among these genes, 81 genes were found differently expressed in reverse direction change, 7 genes were found differently expressed in same direction change. The genes altered were mainly related to material metabolism, immunity and inflammatory reaction, signal transduction, translation, transcription, et al. The expressions of genes tested by RT-PCR were in accordance with those detected by cDNA microarray. CONCLUSION: A. mongholicus may play protective roles in diabetic nephropathy through multiple pathways at gene level. The effect of A. mongholicus in genes related to material metabolism is more significant.
