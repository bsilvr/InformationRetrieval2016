[Studies on chemical constituents of Astragalus dahuricus]OBJECTIVE: To study the chemical constituents in Astragalus dahuricus. METHOD: The compounds were isolated and purified by column chromatography on silica gel and HPLC, and their structures were elucidated by their spectroscopic evidences. RESULT: Six compounds were identified as: 7, 2'-dihydroxy-3', 4'-dimethoxyisoflavan (1), 2'-hydroxy-3', 4'-dimethoxyisoflavan-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2), 8, 2'-dihydroxy-7, 4'-dimethoxyisoflavan (3), 7-hydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone (4), 7, 3'-dihydroxy-4'-metho-xyisoflavone (5), 9, 10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (6). CONCLUSION: Compounds 1-6 were obtained from this plant for the first time.
