Effect of total flavonoid fraction of Astragalus complanatus R. Brown on angiotensin II-induced portal-vein contraction in hypertensive rats.The objective of the present study was to examine further the underlying mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of the total flavonoid (TF), extracted from the seed of Astragalus complanatus R.Brown. Renovascular hypertension rats (RHR) were established by the two-kidney one clip (2K1C) method. The effect of TF on the contraction of portal vein was studied in an isolated preparation. The response of portal vein to angiotensin II (Ang II) was expressed as a percentage of the 100 mmol/l KCl induced maximum contraction. We took the dose-response curve of portal vein to Ang II (from 10(-9) to 10(-6) mmol/l) as the control and then observed the change of curve after TF and Valsartan (Ang II receptor blocker) administration. Ang II induced a concentration-dependent increase of the contraction amplitude (maximal increase, 46.53+/-5.15% of 100 mmol/l KCl induced contraction at Ang II 10(-6) mmol/l in RHR). The Ang II-induced portal vein contraction was prevented by TF with a concentration related manner (maximal inhibition amplitude from 46.53+/-5.15% to 22.525+/-4.67% of 100 mmol/l KCl contraction at 10(-6)mmol/l Ang II and 3.12 x 10(-1) mg/l TF in RHR). The effect of TF on Ang II-induced portal vein contraction was similar to Valsartan. These results showed that the antihypertensive action of TF was attributed to the dilation of vessels and is related to the blockade of the Ang II receptor.
