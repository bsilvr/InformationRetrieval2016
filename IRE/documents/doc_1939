Immunorestoration and augmentation of mitogen lymphocyte response in Graffi tumor bearing hamsters by purified saponin mixture from Astragalus corniculatus.Investigations on the effect of purified saponin mixture (PSM) obtained from the aerial parts of Astragalus corniculatus Bieb. (Fabaceae) on mitogen response of the spleen cells in Graffi tumor bearing (GTBH) and healthy hamsters were reported. The saponin mixture in a doses of 50mg/kg b.w. was injected i.p. 4 times starting simultaneously with implantation of tumor cells. Stimulation indices to phytohemagglutinine (PHA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of lymphocytes in spleens of tumor bearing hamsters (TBH) were significantly decreased during the whole period of the observation. It was established that PSM stimulated the functions of spleen cells in Graffi-TBH, resulting in increased mitogen response to PHA and LPS. The stimulation was better expressed in healthy PSM-treated hamsters. The proliferation response of spleen lymphocytes to PSM was also found. PSM did not change the in vitro proliferation ability of Graffi tumor cells. The results obtained proved the immunostimulating and immunorestorating activity of PSM on the T- and B-spleen cells in healthy and GTBH hamsters, as well as the proliferative response of it to PSM.
