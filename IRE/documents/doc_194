Environmental contexts surrounding resolution of drinking problems among problem drinkers with different help-seeking experiences.OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether similar environmental contexts surround abstinent resolutions associated with different intervention experiences, including no assistance. METHOD: Participants were selected in a 3 x 2 design (25-30 per group, N = 167) according to their help-seeking experiences (no assistance, Alcoholics Anonymous [AA] only, treatment plus AA) and current drinking status (resolved abstinent [RA] for &gt;2 years or nonresolved [NR] controls). Life events were assessed retrospectively over a 4-year period that spanned the 2 years before and 2 years after the initiation of stable abstinence by RA participants or over a matched interval for NR participants. Collateral or reliability interviews were conducted for 84% of the sample as checks on participant reports. RESULTS: Across help-seeking groups, RA participants reported decreased negative events and increased positive events from the pre- through the post-resolution period. Interventions, especially treatment, enhanced the postresolution improvements in RA participants' life circumstances. This pattern was absent among NR participants. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a similar molar environmental context surrounds resolutions achieved with and without interventions and that interventions are associated with enhanced improvements during maintenance.
