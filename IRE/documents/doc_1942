Triterpene glycosides from the roots of Astragalus flavescens.Six new triterpene saponins, 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl-21-epi-kudzusapogenol A (1), 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl-21-epi-kudzusapogenol A (2), 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl-22-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-21-epi-kudzusapogenol A (3), 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl-22-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-21-epi-kudzusapogenol A (4), 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl-22-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-21-epi-kudzusapogenol A (5), and 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl-22-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-21-epi-kudzusapogenol A (6), were isolated from the roots of Astragalus flavescens, together with the known trajanoside B, azukisaponin V, and astragalosides IV, VII, and VIII. Their structures were established mainly by 2D NMR techniques and mass spectrometry.
