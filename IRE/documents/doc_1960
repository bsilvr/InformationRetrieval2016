[Effect of Astragalus mongholicus on inducing differentiations of rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into neurocyte-like cells]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differentiations of rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into neurocyte-like cells induced by Astragalus mongholicus. METHODS: We isolated the nucleated cells from rat bone marrows through gradient centrifugation, and cultured and purified the MSCs. The non-serum-L-DMEM containing Astragalus mongholicus was used to induce the differentiations of the MSCs into neurcyte-like cells. The morphologic changes of the differentiated cells were observed. The expressions of the nestin, neuron specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were detected by immuncytochemistrical staining. The expressions of the Wnt-1 gene and neurogenin-1 (Ngn-1)gene were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: The subculturing cells were fibroblast-like, with higher reproductive activities than the primary cells. The Astragalus mongholicus induced morphology changes of the MSCs. The immunocytochemistrical staining of Nestin, NSE and GFAP were positive. The MSCs became neuron-like and gliocyte-like cells. The Astragalus mongholicus also enhanced the expression of Wnt-1 gene and Ngn-1 gene. CONCLUSION: The MS(s can be isolated and cultured in vitro. and can differentiate into neurocyte-like and gliocyte-like cells. Wnt-1 gene and Ngn-1 gene play important regulatory roles during the differentiation of the rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to neurocyte-like cells.
