Update on the changing numbers and distribution of periodontists.A review of the 2006 and past American Dental Association (ADA) studies on the distribution of dentists provides information on the evolving number of periodontists. Despite an overall increase in the number of periodontists, major differences continue in practitioner/population ratios in different geographic areas. As in past reviews, suggestions are offered for efforts by the ADA and/or the American Academy of Periodontology to draw attention to the limited numbers of periodontists in particular regions and states; to increase efforts to educate the public on the need and value of periodontal services; and to increase the profession's awareness of the growing diversity in the nation's population and the need to modify and adjust its efforts to attract underserved populations with different familial, cultural, and educational backgrounds.
