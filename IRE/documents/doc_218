What guides professional behavior of dentists?The purpose of this paper is to explore the question of what guides professional behavior in the hope that those who read it will reflect on how they conduct their relationships with patients, business associates, and employees. I propose that the ADA Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct are only a portion of what guides dentists' ethical behavior. The Principles and Code are founded on basic personal ethics and societal standards, and in the U.S. they are in turn the foundation for the state dental practice acts.
