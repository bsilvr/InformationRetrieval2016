Toothbrush selection: a dilemma?The toothbrush is a fundamental tool used for accomplishing plaque control. Various types of toothbrushes available in the market keep the buyer in a state of dilemma as to which one to choose, due to lack of information about the  quality  of it. This study has been designed to understand whether all the products available in the market adhere to the specifications laid down by the ADA, which is universally accepted in standardization of a tooth brush. 95% of the brushes surveyed contain less number of bristles per tuft than specified and a large percentage deviate from the standard prescribed value for their bristle diameter and other dimensions. Few brushes labeled as  Soft  were  Medium  and labeled  Medium  were  Hard . The study will bring to light the quality of toothbrushes available in India for a rationalised selection of appropriate toothbrush by the community at large.
