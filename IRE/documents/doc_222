Health and wellness for women in the profession.Regardless of gender, dentists can and do experience illness and other problems that may disrupt or impair dental practice, including substance abuse involving alcohol and/or other drugs. As part of the ethical obligation to maintain public confidence through responsible and effective self-governance, the American Dental Association (ADA) and state dental components offer health and wellness resources to members through programs such as CDAD-Dentist Well-Being Committee. Though the percentage of women entering the dental profession has consistently increased, utilization of CDAD resources by female dentists remains low. In order for the profession to fully address the needs of its changing membership, dentists need to understand gender differences associated with risk for abuse of alcohol and other substances; related physical, emotional, and professional effects; and other aspects of professional health and wellness. As more information on substance abuse in female and male dentists emerges, CDAD is prepared to support, educate, and advocate for the health and wellness of all colleagues in the dental profession.
