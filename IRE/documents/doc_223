Interest and responsibility of ADA in dental licensure.Initial licensure is a critical milestone and point of entry to the profession; it should go without saying that the organization that represents more than 70% of professionally active dentists would care deeply about the process that determines the character of its future and defines its image in the eyes of the public. The American Dental Association's (ADA) documented history of activity and leadership on licensure issues and the organization's guiding documents (Strategic Plan, Current Policies, Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct and Constitution and Bylaws) all lend credence to the Association's role in the licensure process. ADA members, other dental organizations, private and governmental agencies, and the public recognize the ADA as an authority on matters relating to dentistry. These circumstances comprise the best available evidence supporting the important role of the ADA in facilitating communication, collaboration and consensus-building in the continuous enhancement of the licensure process to meet the needs of all stakeholders.
