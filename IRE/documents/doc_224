The ADA perspective.BACKGROUND: The American Dental Association (ADA) has long relied on available scientific evidence in its commitment to use credible scientific data and analyses in policy-making, and its communications with the dental profession and the public. OVERVIEW: The evidence-based dentistry (EBD) process is a systematic approach that reviews and publishes the evidence relevant to specific clinical questions. The goal of this process is to help practitioners provide patients with quality oral health care. The ADA has developed a strategic plan of EBD initiatives and activities in order to increase the knowledge base and improve educational programs; to encourage significant collaboration on EBD-related issues from interested organizations, specialty groups, and various outside agencies; and to increasingly derive the best scientific evidence for use in clinical practice in concert with professional judgment and patient treatment preferences. CONCLUSION: The ADA endeavors to provide relevant information that can assist dentists in translating systematic-review findings and implementing an evidence-based approach in everyday clinical practice. This supports the Association's goal to continue supporting the best available evidence to assist health care teams in the provision of quality patient care and preventive techniques that improve oral health care outcomes.
