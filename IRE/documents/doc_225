Reaction to universal patient acceptance: The perspective of a private practice dentist.The purpose of this article is to respond to the theories of Acceptance and Universal Patient Acceptance and their relationship to the American Dental Association's Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct (ADA Code). Universal Patient Acceptance (UPA) requires the dentist to communicate in some fashion with each patient who attempts to enter his or her practice to determine needs, desires, and financial ability to access dental care. The dentist must then help the patient gain entry into his or her practice or make appropriate referrals based on the patient's desires, needs, and financial status. The theory of UPA proposes that this action will alleviate some portion of the access problem. This article explores the notion of access as articulated in the ADA Code. The theory of UPA is explored from the view of the practicing dentist, noting the difficulties encountered when incorporating this theory into private practice. The conclusion is that the ADA Code offers appropriate guidance for ADA members regarding the ethical treatment of the underserved. Without further study, the inclusion of UPA in the ADA Code is not desirable. The author also concludes that support systems for the practicing dentist are necessary before UPA could be considered a reasonable way to practice dentistry.
