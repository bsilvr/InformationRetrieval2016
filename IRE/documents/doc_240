Entrepreneurship in continuing dental education: a dental school perspective.The definition of continuing dental education is presented, along with its benefits to the profession. The preeminence of dental schools in providing lifelong learning opportunities and freedom from commercial involvement that existed even twenty years ago has changed. Less than a quarter of CE takes place in school, and the focus there is increasingly on material with deep scientific background and hands-on learning. The newest innovations and those with the greatest commercial potential are taught elsewhere. Proposed changes in the ADA CERP standards would take on a  purist  approach that could place dental schools at a severe disadvantage while allowing  for profit  institutes to flourish and thus further undermine the role dental schools can play in providing quality professional development experiences.
