ADA initiates development of orthodontic informatics standards.Standards are the key to interoperability across systems. The American Dental Association (ADA) has been accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a standards-developing organization. The ADA sponsors standards programs for all areas of dentistry, including dental materials and products and dental informatics. ANSI/ADA Specification No. 1000, Standard Clinical Data Architecture for the Structure and Content of an Electronic Health Record, is the first ANSI standard that defines the fundamental data structures used to make patient health records. The standard promotes the sharing of like data between dentists, physicians, and hospitals.
