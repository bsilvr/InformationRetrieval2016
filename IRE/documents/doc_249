A look at allied dental education in the United States.BACKGROUND: The American Dental Association conducts surveys of educational programs in dental assisting, dental hygiene and dental laboratory technology. The 2002-2003 survey included questions about enrollment, graduates, program information and trends. METHODS: The ADA Survey Center mailed the Survey of Allied Dental Education to 548 program directors of dental assisting, dental hygiene and dental laboratory technology educational programs. They also sent several follow-up notices as a reminder to complete the survey. A 100 percent response rate is mandatory for continued accreditation by the Commission on Dental Accreditation. Association staff members resolved inconsistencies in the data and analyzed them before producing a final report. RESULTS: The number of applications to, first-year enrollment in and number of graduates in dental hygiene and dental assisting educational programs have increased during the last five years. During the same period, the number of applications to, and graduates of, dental laboratory technology educational programs decreased, but first-year enrollment increased slightly. CONCLUSIONS: Results from these surveys help address the concerns of the public and the profession regarding allied dental manpower levels. They also provide information for those interested in applying to individual allied dental educational programs. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Private dental practices employ the majority of graduates of allied dental educational programs. Recent graduates of dental assisting and hygiene programs continue to supply the office staff members needed to support the delivery of dental care.
