Standardized ileal amino acid digestibility in wheat distillers dried grains with solubles for broilers.A study was conducted to estimate the ileal digestibility of amino acids (AA) in 5 different samples of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) fed to broilers. Two hundred sixteen male Ross broiler chicks were fed a commercial starter diet from d 1 to 15 of age followed by the test diets from d 15 to 21. The 5 test diets consisted of a DDGS sample or wheat as the sole source of AA, dextrose, minerals, and vitamins. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was included in all diets as a digestibility marker. Each test diet was randomly assigned to 6 replicate cages, each with 6 birds. On d 21, birds were killed to sample ileal digesta for determining the apparent (AID) and standardized (SID) ileal AA digestibilities. The SID values were calculated using ileal endogenous AA losses previously determined in our laboratory. Among the indispensable AA in wheat DDGS, the lowest and highest AID average values were observed for Lys (35.6%) and Phe (79.2%), respectively. The most variable AID estimates of wheat DDGS samples were observed for Lys (24.4 to 45.7%), Thr (48.2 to 60.9%), and His (57.4 to 69.1%) as indispensable and Asp (32.5 to 50.9%), Gly (49.6 to 63.1%), and Ala (53.6 to 66.8%) as dispensable AA, respectively. Apparent ileal digestibility estimates of the wheat sample for Lys, Thr, His, Gly, and Ala were 77.5, 74, 83.6, 79.3, and 78.9%, respectively. All AA digestibility estimates for both AID and SID determined in wheat were higher than in wheat DDGS samples (P &lt; 0.05). Considering both AID and SID coefficients of wheat DDGS samples, Lys was the least digestible AA, averaging 35.6 and 40.0%, respectively. Using SID values in practical diet formulation can increase accuracy, prevent overformulation of diets, and reduce cost of safety margins.
