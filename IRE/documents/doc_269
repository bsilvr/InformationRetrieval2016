The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the practice of dentistry in the United States: electronic transactions.This article reviews the kinds of electronic transactions required under the Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act (HIPAA) and relates them to relevant data contained in an electronic oral health record (EOHR). It also outlines the structure of HIPAA transactions using the claim transaction as an example. The relationship of the HIPAA resource management function to those of patient care are discussed. The discussion points out potential future uses of other existing resource management transactions to realize the maximum potential of linking the primary patient care functions to those functions related to managing resources in support of that care. This is needed in all aspects of oral health using the informatics standards activities in which the American Dental Association (ADA) actively participates. The article concludes by providing the dentist a perspective on how to relate these capabilities to his/her individual practice setting.
