A duty to disclose. Issues to consider in securing informed consent.BACKGROUND: This article reviews the historical development of informed consent law and highlights factors dentists must consider when deciding how to obtain valid informed consent from patients. CONCLUSIONS: Informed consent laws vary from state to state. Dentists should review the laws in their states to determine when they are legally required to obtain informed consent, what information must be disclosed for the consent to be valid and how to secure consent for minor patients and adult patients who are not legally competent. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Dentists should ensure that they are familiar with and in compliance with the informed consent laws in their states. ADA-member dentists also should be mindful of their ethical obligation to inform patients of proposed treatment and reasonable alternatives.
