ADA members weigh in on critical issues.BACKGROUND: Science, new technology, patient care, dental reimbursement and government regulations all affect today's dental practitioners. To find out more about how such challenges may affect current private practitioners, the American Dental Association conducted the 2000 Membership Needs and Opinions Survey. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 6,310 ADA members in January 2000 with follow-up mailings in February, March and April 2000. Data collection was completed in July 2000. The survey included questions on critical professional issues, and on perceptions of the ADA and ADA priorities. A total of 3,558 completed surveys were received for an adjusted response rate of 59.5 percent. RESULTS: Members rated the identified issues' level of importance to them. The top three issues included  maintaining my ability to recommend the treatment option I feel is most appropriate for my patients,   receiving fair reimbursement for the dental services I provide,  and  protecting myself, my staff and my patients from communicable diseases.  New dentists found other items to be more significant to them compared with members overall. CONCLUSIONS: Although ADA members as a whole had similar views on critical issues facing dentistry and ADA priorities, there were significant differences regarding some issues. New dentists were far more concerned about securing funds for their practice and paying off debt than were all ADA members. Minority dentists expressed greater levels of concern about certain issues than did all ADA members. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: When planning and implementing ADA activities, the Association should continue to take into account members' relative rankings of professional issues and note issues of special interest to selected membership subgroups.
