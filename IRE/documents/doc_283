Visible light-curing unit.Ortholux XT is a high-intensity light source emitting filtered visible blue light in the 400- to 500-nanometer range for polymerization of visible-light-cured resins. The Ortholux handpiece comes with a portable power supply, a light-intensity check in the power supply, a spare lamp, an eyeshield and a mounting kit. The handpiece consists of a pistol grip with a thermoplastic housing that contains the light source, cooling fan, light guide receptacle (8- or 13-millimeter-diameter fused quartz lightguide), optical filter, light switch and timer switch. The timer is operator-selectable with options of five, 10, 15 and 20 seconds and an XT option of up to 600 seconds. The push-button switch allows for timer disruption and reactivation. 3M Unitek reported (3M Unitek, unpublished data submitted to the ADA, date not known) that the cooling fan generates noise below 43 decibels when the internal handpiece temperature is below 100 C. At 120 C, the fan speed increases, generating 52 dBA. The U.S. Air Force Dental Investigative Service reported that the cooling fan is extremely quiet. The light shuts off when it reaches 140 C. The light source is a 75-watt tungsten/halogen lamp. The handpiece weighs less than one pound. The power supply contains the built-in intensity meter that illuminates a green light-emitting diode when the tested light exceeds 400 milliwatts per square centimeter. The power cord is six feet in length. A built-in voltage regulator ensures a steady voltage supply to the unit.
