ADA guidelines for the acceptance of tooth-whitening products.Since the introduction of at-home tooth whitening using peroxide-containing agents in 1989, the procedure has been well-received by the public and is becoming one of the most popular cosmetic dental procedures today. To ensure the safety and efficacy of this treatment, the Guidelines for the Acceptance of this category of products by the American Dental Association were developed. This article provides background on the American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Acceptance Program. It also offers an overview of the ADA Acceptance Program Guidelines for Home-Use Tooth Whitening Products as well as the process through which the document was developed.
