Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid adenosine deaminase activity in HIV-seropositive subjects and its association with lactate dehydrogenase and protein levels.The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of ADA as additional marker of HIV infection as well as its association with other biochemical markers. This study included 55 patients, 26 being diagnosed as HIV positive and 29 patients diagnosed as HIV negative. Glucose, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity were measured on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). ADA activity on CSF was statistically different in HIV-seropositive subjects compared with HIV-negative subjects. The sensitivity and specificity of ADA activity on CSF was 50 and 82.76%, respectively. ADA activity was positively correlated with lactate dehydrogenase and protein in patients with HIV positive and it was negatively correlated with glucose levels. ADA determination in CSF could add information about inflammatory processes in patients with HIV infection.
