Kinetic and conformational studies of adenosine deaminase upon interaction with oxazepam and lorazepam.Oxazepam and lorazepam inhibit the adenosine deaminase (ADA) differently. In the case of lorazepam temperature increment causes an increase in the inhibition potency whereas higher temperature reduces the inhibitory effect of oxazepam; which proposes the overall profounder structural changes in the case of lorazepam relative to those caused by oxazepam.
