Betaine (trimethylglycine) as a nutritional agent prevents oxidative stress after chronic ethanol consumption in pancreatic tissue of rats.In this study, we investigated the free radical-mediated cytotoxic effects of chronic ethanol consumption on the pancreatic tissue and a possible cytoprotective effect of betaine as a methyl donor and an important participant in the methionine cycle. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into control, ethanol, and ethanol+betaine groups. Prior to sacrifice, all groups were fed 60 mL/diet per day for two months. Rats in the ethanol group were fed with ethanol 8 g/kg/day. The ethanol+betaine groups were fed ethanol plus betaine (0.5 % w/v). Malondialdehyde levels and adenosine deaminase, superoxide dismutase, and xanthine oxidase activities were determined in pancreatic tissues of rats. Compared to control group, MDA levels increased significantly in the ethanol group (p&lt;0.05). MDA levels in the ethanol+betaine group were significantly decreased compared to the ethanol group (p&lt;0.05). ADA activity in the ethanol+betaine group decreased significantly when compared to the ethanol group (p&lt;0.05). XO activities in ethanol-fed rats were decreased significantly compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). XO activity in the betaine group was increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) compared to the ethanol group. SOD activity in the ethanol group decreased significantly compared to control group (p&lt;0.001). SOD activity in the ethanol+betaine group decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) compared to the control group. We think that betaine, as a nutritional methylating agent, may be effective against ethanol-mediated oxidative stress in pancreatic tissue.
