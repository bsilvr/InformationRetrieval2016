Effects of ractopamine hydrochloride are not confined to mammalian tissue: evidence for direct effects of ractopamine hydrochloride supplementation on fermentation by ruminal microorganisms.Four experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) on ruminal fermentation and proteolysis. In Exp. 1, in vitro gas and VFA production was measured in flasks incubated with 0, 0.226, 2.26, 22.6, and 226.0 mg of RAC/L of buffered ruminal fluid. Ractopamine hydrochloride had a quadratic effect on in vitro gas production (P &lt; 0.05; 177, 181, 185, 190, and 170 mL for 0, 0.226, 2.26, 22.6, and 226.0 mg, respectively). Total VFA production was not significantly changed with RAC (P &gt; 0.50). In Exp. 2, IVDMD was measured with tubes incubated with 0, 0.226, 2.26, or 22.6 mg of RAC/L of buffered ruminal fluid with 4 substrate combinations: corn, corn plus soybean meal, corn plus urea, and corn plus soybean meal plus urea. Dry matter disappearance was measured after 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 h of fermentation. There was an interaction between RAC and substrate (P &lt; 0.01), with more degradable forms of nitrogen eliciting greater IVDMD from RAC. Significant main effects also were detected for RAC, substrate, and hour (P &lt; 0.001). In Exp. 3, AA and ammonia were measured in tubes treated with 0 or 2.26 mg of RAC/L of buffered ruminal fluid. Tubes were incubated for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, or 240 min. There were decreases in ammonia and AA concentrations with RAC (P &lt; 0.001). Experiment 4 used 16 ruminally fistulated Holstein steers in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Factors consisted of grain processing method (steam-flaked or dry-rolled corn), concentration of dried distillers grains (DG) with solubles (0 or 25% DG, DM basis), and concentration of RAC (0 or 200 mg/d). Ruminal ammonia concentrations were less when RAC was fed in combination with dry-rolled corn, but not when RAC was fed in conjunction with steam-flaked corn (grain processing x RAC, P &lt; 0.01). Addition of RAC, steam-flaked corn, and DG all resulted in reduced ruminal ammonia concentrations (P &lt; 0.01). Amino acid concentrations were decreased when RAC was added to diets with DG but were unchanged in diets without added DG (DG x RAC, P &lt; 0.05). Changes in ruminal ammonia and AA concentrations with RAC supplementation are dependent on grain processing and the addition of DG to finishing diets. Results from these studies suggest that RAC affects fermentation by ruminal microflora. Effects of the interactions between RAC and protein source, grain processing, and DG on proteolysis could have important implications when formulating diets for cattle supplemented with RAC.
