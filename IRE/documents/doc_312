Anti-inflammatory evaluation of Coronopus didymus in the pleurisy and paw oedema models in mice.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mastrun√ßo (Coronopus didymus--CD) is currently considered as a medicinal specie often used in Brazil, especially in southeast region, for the treatment of several diseases in which pain and inflammation are common. Treatment with the plant can be done by infusion, decoction, or through food. The aim of this study was: to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of hydroalcoholic extract obtained from the leaves of CD following the traditional procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-inflammatory activity was determined using mouse of pleurisy and paw oedema models, both process being induced by different flogistic agents such as: carrageenan (Cg), bradykinin (BK), histamine (HIS), substance P (SP), dextran (DEX) or prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). We evaluated the effect of CD (200-600 mg/kg) administered by oral route (p.o.) upon leukocytes migration, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and adenosine-deaminase (ADA) activities and nitric oxide (NO) levels. RESULTS: CD (200-600 mg/kg) inhibited the leukocytes by 60.0+/-1.42%, neutrophils by 82.75+/-1.29%, MPO by 42.30+/-4.23%, and ADA activities by 57.89+/-1.94%, as well as NO levels by 64.28+/-2.15% in Cg induced pleurisy. CD also inhibited total and differential leukocytes in the pleurisy induced by BK (1.30+/-0.11/0.29+/-0.02), HIS (1.20+/-0.09/0.42+/-0.05) and SP (0.74+/-0.06/0.14+/-0.01). In addition, CD was effective in reducing paw oedema induced by Cg by 72.79+/-1.13%, SP by 68.26.+/-0.78%, BK by 66.66.+/-0.77%, PGE(2) by 53.346.+/-1.18 and DEX by 65.14+/-2.35%. CONCLUSION: Several mechanisms, including the inhibition of enzymes (MPO and ADA) and mediators (BK, HIS, SP, NO and PGE(2)) release and/or action, appear to account for the anti-inflammatory effect of Coronopus didymus.
