The activity and expression of NTPDase is altered in lymphocytes of multiple sclerosis patients.BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating neurological disease, which is presumed to be a consequence of infiltrating lymphocytes that are autoreactive to myelin proteins. ATP and adenosine contribute to fine-tuning immune responses and NTPDase (CD39) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) are important enzymes in the control of the extracellular levels of these molecules at the site of inflammation. We evaluated the activity and expression of NTPDase and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in lymphocytes from patients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS (RRMS). METHODS: This study involved 22 patients with RRMS and 22 healthy subjects as a control group. The lymphocytes were isolated from blood and separated on Ficoll density gradients and after isolation the NTPDase and ADA activities were determined. RESULTS: The NTPDase activity and expression were increased in lymphocytes from RRMS patients when compared with the control group (p&lt;0.05). In addition, a decrease in ADA activity was observed in lymphocytes from these patients when compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The regulation of ATP and adenosine levels by NTPDase and ADA activities may be important to preserve cellular integrity and to modulate the immune response in MS.
