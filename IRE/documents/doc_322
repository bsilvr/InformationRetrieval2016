Generation and accumulation of immunosuppressive adenosine by human CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ regulatory T cells.Naturally occurring regulatory T cells (nTreg) are crucial for maintaining tolerance to self and thus preventing autoimmune diseases and allograft rejections. In cancer, Treg down-regulate antitumor responses by several distinct mechanisms. This study analyzes the role the adenosinergic pathway plays in suppressive activities of human nTreg. Human CD4(+)CD25(high)FOXP3(+) Treg overexpress CD39 and CD73, ectonucleotidases sequentially converting ATP into AMP and adenosine, which then binds to A(2a) receptors on effector T cells, suppressing their functions. CD4(+)CD39(+) and CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells express low levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA), the enzyme responsible for adenosine breakdown, and of CD26, a surface-bound glycoprotein associated with ADA. In contrast, T effector cells are enriched in CD26/ADA but express low levels of CD39 and CD73. Inhibitors of ectonucleotidase activity (e.g. ARL67156) and antagonists of the A(2a) receptor (e.g. ZM241385) blocked Treg-mediated immunosuppression. The inhibition of ADA activity on effector T cells enhanced Treg-mediated immunosuppression. Thus, human nTreg characterized by the presence of CD39 and the low expression of CD26/ADA are responsible for the generation of adenosine, which plays a major role in Treg-mediated immunosuppression. The data suggest that the adenosinergic pathway represents a potential therapeutic target for regulation of immunosuppression in a broad variety of human diseases.
