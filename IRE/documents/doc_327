Adenosine and osteopontin contribute to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health concern. Adenosine, a signaling molecule generated in response to cell stress, contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD. An established model of adenosine-mediated lung injury is the adenosine deaminase-deficient (Ada(-/-)) mouse. Osteopontin (OPN) is a chemokine that is produced following injury and is implicated in a variety of human pathologies, but its expression and role in the pathogenesis of COPD have not been examined. To investigate the role of OPN in a model of COPD, Ada(-/-) double-knockout mice were generated, and inflammation and air-space enlargement endpoints were examined. Results demonstrate that Ada(-/-) mice exhibit OPN-dependent neutrophilia, alveolar air-space enlargement, and increases in mediators of air-space enlargement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that patients with COPD have increased OPN expression within distal airways in association with clinical airway obstruction. These results suggest that OPN represents a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with COPD.
