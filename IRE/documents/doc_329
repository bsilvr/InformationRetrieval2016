Activities of adenosine deaminase and 5'-nucleotidase in cancereous and non-cancereous human gastric tissues.INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer is still one of the most common fatal types of cancer in the world. The abnormalities in purine metabolism are a characteristic feature of many human tumors. Little is known about the correlation between the activities of key enzymes of purine nucleotide pathway and some clinical indicators of gastric cancer invasiveness and aggressiveness. METHOD: Seventeen (11 men, 6 women) patients with gastric cancer were admitted to the hospital. The activities of Adenosine deaminase (ADA) and 5'-nucleotidase (5'NT) in their cancerous and non-cancerous tissues were measured. RESULTS: 5'NT activities were significantly higher in cancerous tissues than in non-cancerous tissues. CONCLUSION: 5'NT activities increased in gastric cancer tissues but had no association with clinicopathologic findings (Tab. 2, Ref. 9). Full Text (Free, PDF) www.bmj.sk.
