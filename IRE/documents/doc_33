Characterization of the nutritional value of air-classified protein and starch fractions of field pea and zero-tannin faba bean in grower pigs.Most pulse (nonoilseed legume) seed flours can be fractionated rapidly and economically by air classification into protein and starch concentrates. The nutritional value of air-classified field pea and faba bean concentrates requires characterization to assess the feeding opportunity for pigs. Thus, the objectives were to characterize the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, OM, energy, starch, CP, fat, and ash; apparent ileal digestibility of CP and starch; standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of AA; and the SID AA, DE, and NE content of air-classified zero-tannin faba bean and field pea protein and starch concentrates in grower pigs. Pulse protein and starch concentrates were compared with soy protein concentrate and corn starch, respectively, as corresponding standards. The corn starch diet served as an N-free diet to correct for basal endogenous AA losses. In a Youden square design, 8 ileal-cannulated barrows (24.9 +/- 2.3 kg of BW) were fed 6 diets over 7 periods at 3 times the maintenance DE requirement. Periods encompassed a 5-d diet acclimation, 3-d feces collection, and 3-d ileal digesta collection. The ATTD of GE was 2% greater (P &lt; 0.05) for faba bean than soy and was intermediate for field pea protein (95.6, 93.7, and 94.9%, respectively). The ATTD of GE was 3.6% greater (P &lt; 0.05) for corn and field pea than faba bean starch (96.2, 95.1, and 92.3%, respectively). The DE content of faba bean was 5.0% greater (P &lt; 0.05) than for field pea or soy protein (4.47, 4.23, and 4.26 Mcal/kg, respectively). The DE content of faba bean and field pea was 1.7% greater (P &lt; 0.05) than for corn starch (3.72, 3.77, and 3.68 Mcal/kg, respectively). The NE content was 5% greater (P &lt; 0.05) for faba bean than field pea and soy protein (3.08, 2.94, and 2.92 Mcal/kg, respectively). The NE content for field pea starch was 2.0% greater (P &lt; 0.05) than for corn starch and faba bean starch (2.68, 2.63, and 2.61 Mcal/kg, respectively). Protein concentrates had a 14 and 11% greater (P &lt; 0.05) DE and NE content, respectively, than starch concentrates. The SID of Lys was 6.0% greater (P &lt; 0.05) for faba bean and field pea protein than soy protein (95.5, 92.6, and 88.7%, respectively). The SID of Lys was 6.0% greater (P &lt; 0.05) for faba bean than field pea starch. Nutrient digestibility and digestible nutrient profiles indicated that air-classified fractions of zero-tannin faba bean and field pea constitute concentrated sources of AA and energy for pigs with high nutritional demands.
