Serum adenosine deaminase activity in gestational diabetes mellitus and normal pregnancy.PURPOSE: To our knowledge, there is no report regarding adenosine deaminase activity (ADA) in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The aim of the present study was to investigate the level of serum ADA activity in normal pregnancy, GDM and normal non-pregnant women. METHODS: The serum catalytic concentration of ADA was measured in samples of 20 GDM, 40 normal pregnant and 20 non-pregnant healthy women. RESULTS: Adenosine deaminase activity was significantly higher in GDM (24.30 +/- 8.04 IU/L) and pregnant women (23.88 +/- 8.66 IU/L) than those of normal non-pregnant individuals (11.85 +/- 3.23 IU/L) (P &lt; 0.0001), but the ADA level was not significantly different from GDM and normal pregnant women (P = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine deaminase activity was significantly higher in GDM and pregnant individuals than normal group in this study. Previous reports in this field are contentious; therefore, ADA activity could be regulated in different population by immunologic and genetic factors.
