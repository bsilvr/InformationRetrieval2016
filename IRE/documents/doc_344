[Some influence factors in determination of serum enzyme in hepatitis patients]OBJECTIVE: To study some factors (temperature, time, anticoagulate, reagent, apparatus) which influence the detection of serum enzyme. METHODS: Serums obtained from same patient are determined in different conditions. Compare the statistical difference among each group. RESULTS: The anticoagulant-heparinize Li influence the determination of ADA and CH50. If serums were sent in room temperature for 24 hours, the results will be different. Using regents from different factories will receive different results. CONCLUSION: Different conditions and reagents will influence results. To obtain correct data, we must institute and perform standard regulation.
