Activity of ectonucleotidases and adenosine deaminase in rats exposed to cigarette smoke.Cigarette smoke is a complex mixture of various toxic substances that are capable of initiating oxidative damage and promoting blood platelet alterations. In this study, we investigated the activities of the ectoenzymes NTPDase (ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase, CD39) and 5'-nucleotidase (CD73) in platelets as well as adenosine deaminase (ADA) in the plasma of rats exposed to aged and diluted sidestream smoke during 4 weeks. The rats were divided into two groups: I (control) and II (exposed to smoke). After the exposure period, blood was collected and the platelets and plasma were separated for enzymatic assay. The results demonstrated that NTPDase (with ATP as substrate) and 5'-nucleotidase (AMP as substrate) activities were significantly higher in group II (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to group I, while no significant difference was observed for NTPDase with ADP as substrate. The ADA activity was significantly reduced in group II (p &lt; 0.05) as compared with group I. Platelet aggregation was significantly increased in group II (p &lt; 0.05) as compared with group I. We suggest that these alterations in the activity of enzymes from the purinergic system are associated with an increase in platelet aggregation. However, our study has demonstrated that the organism tries to compensate for this enhanced aggregation by increasing hydrolysis of AMP and reducing hydrolysis of adenosine, a potent inhibitor of aggregation and an important modulator of vascular tone.
