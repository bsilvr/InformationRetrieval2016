Enhanced activity or resistance of adenosine derivatives towards adenosine deaminase-catalyzed deamination: Influence of ribose modifications.The effect of the presence of the 1'-C-methyl group and 2',3'-O-substitution in the adenosine structure on ADA activity has been investigated by modeling studies. Results show that the 2'- and 3'-O- substituents are harbored in a quite large cavity of intermediate polarity, whereas the 1'-C-substituent clashes against Ala180 distorting the architecture of the catalytic centre. Globally, the study emphasizes the ability of ADA to transform a large set of 2',3'-O-substituted adenosine analogues as well as the opportunity to design 1'-C-substituted adenosine derivatives resistant to ADA-catalyzed deamination.
