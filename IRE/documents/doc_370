Adenosine deaminase in patients with primary immunodeficiency syndromes: the analysis of serum ADA1 and ADA2 activities.OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the activity of ADA and its isoenzymes in serum of patients with various primary immunodeficiency (PID) syndromes. DESIGN AND METHODS: Total ADA (tADA) and its isoenzymes were measured in 76 children with PID syndromes and 30 healthy controls using the Ellis method. RESULTS: Our results indicated that tADA and ADA2 levels were higher in patients with Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD), hyper IgM (HIM) and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) than those of corresponding controls (P&lt;0.01). There was a significant elevation of tADA and ADA1 activities in IgA deficiency patients as compared to healthy individuals (P&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results hypothesized that altered ADA activity may be associated with altered immunity. Therefore, serum ADA level could be used as an indicator along with other parameters in follow up of patients with CGD, LAD, IgA deficiency, HIM and WAS.
