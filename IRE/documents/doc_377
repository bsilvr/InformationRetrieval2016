[Diagnostic characteristics of adenosine deaminase test in Byelorussian patients with tuberculous pleurisy]The results of studying the diagnostic value of changes in the pleural fluid and serum activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and its isozymes are analyzed in Byelorussian patients with tuberculous pleurisy. There is an increased serum and pleural fluid ADA activity in the patients with tuberculous pleurisy caused mainly by a rise in ADA2 activity. The test determining the activity of ADA, and ADA2 in particular, has shown high sensitivity and specificity as compared with the results obtained in other countries. The diagnostic efficacy of determination of these indices in the serum is also high, but it is lower than that in the pleural fluid.
