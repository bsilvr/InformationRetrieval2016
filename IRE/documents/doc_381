Complex of dipeptidyl peptidase II with adenosine deaminase.Dipeptidyl peptidase II (DPPII) from bovine kidney cortex and lung was purified to the electrophoretically homogeneous state. The molecular and catalytic characteristics of the enzyme were determined. It was revealed that DPPII preparations possess adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity at all purification steps. For the first time, the ADA-binding ability of DPPII has been shown similar to the well-known ADA-binding enzyme, DPPIV. The dissociation constant of the DPPII-ADA complex was estimated using a resonant mirror biosensor (80 nM), fluorescence polarization (60 nM), and differential spectroscopy (36 nM) techniques. The data demonstrate that DPPII can form a complex with ADA, but with one order of magnitude higher dissociation constant than that of DPPIV (7.8 nM).
