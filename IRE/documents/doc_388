[The influence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on deaminase adenosine activity]The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence ofnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on deaminase adenosine activity using animal model. 70 rats of Wistar breed was divided into equal groups of ten. Animals were given intragastrically for three weeks: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) at doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg bw/day, diclofenac at doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg bw/day, nimesulide at doses of 2.5 mg and 12.5 mg/kg bw/day. Control group received only water. After 21 days rats were decapitated and blood was collected to assess deaminase adenosine activity in plasma and erythrocytes. It was found that all investigated drugs inhibit ADA activity in plasma and ADA2 isoenzyme is responsible for this inhibition. Deaminase adenosine activity in erythrocytes is inhibited by ASA and diclofenac but increased by nimesulide.
