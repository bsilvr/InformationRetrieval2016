Biocatalysed concurrent production of enantioenriched compounds through parallel interconnected kinetic asymmetric transformations.Parallel interconnected kinetic asymmetric transformations were performed in order to obtain enantioenriched derivatives starting from a set of racemic or prochiral compounds. Thus, in a one-pot reaction using two redox biocatalysts (a BVMO and an ADH) and a catalytic amount of cofactor that acts as a mediator, enantioenriched ketones, sulfoxides, and sec-alcohols were concurrently obtained in a strict parallel way, minimising the quantity of reagents employed. By selecting the appropriate biocatalysts, this methodology represents a potential tool for performing stereodivergent transformations.
