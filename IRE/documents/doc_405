Pharmacophore mapping via cross-relaxation during adiabatic fast passage.A novel NMR method is demonstrated for the investigation of protein ligand interactions. In this approach an adiabatic fast passage pulse, i.e. a long, weak pulse with a linear frequency sweep, is used to probe (1)H-(1)H NOEs. During the adiabatic fast passage the effective rotating-frame NOE is a weighted average of transverse and longitudinal cross-relaxation contributions that can be tuned by pulse power and frequency sweep rate. It is demonstrated that the occurrence of spin diffusion processes leads to sizable deviations from the theoretical relationship between effective relaxation rate and effective tilt angle in the spin lock frame and can be used to probe protein-ligand binding. This methodology comprises high sensitivity and ease of implementation. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated with two protein complexes, vanillic acid bound to the quail lipocalin Q83 and NAD(+) and AMP binding to alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).
