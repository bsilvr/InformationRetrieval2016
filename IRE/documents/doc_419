Induction of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and heat shock protein expression by ethanol and modulation by fenugreek seed polyphenols in Chang liver cells.The present study investigated the effect of fenugreek seed polyphenolic extract (FPEt) on ethanol-induced protein expression in Chang liver cells. Cells were incubated with either 30 mM EtOH alone or together in the presence of FPEt for 24 h. Cells were harvested and assessed for expression of alcohol metabolizing enzymes-alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH(2) isoform), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH(2) isoform), cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1), the electron transport component (cytochrome-c), and the heat shock proteins. The expression of ADH(2), ALDH(2), and CYP2E1 were upregulated, whereas the expression of cytochrome-c was downregulated in the ethanol-treated cells. The expression of cellular heat shock proteins-HSP70, HSC70, HSC92, and mitochondrial protein mtHSP70 were induced in ethanol-treated Chang liver cells. FPEt modulated the protein expression changes induced by ethanol and had no effect when incubated with normal Chang liver cells. FPEt might exert cytoprotective action on ethanol-induced liver cell damage, possibly by enhancing cellular redox status.
