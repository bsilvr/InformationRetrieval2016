Alcohol dehydrogenase gene expression in Chironomus riparius exposed to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is an industrial additive that is widely used as a plasticizer. Due to its widespread use, DEHP is often found in freshwater ecosystems and many freshwater species have been exposed to various levels of DEHP in natural aquatic systems. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is a metabolizing enzyme produced in response to exposure to DEHP. To evaluate the effects of DEHP exposure on the ADH metabolizing process of Chironomus, the full-length cDNA of ADH from Chironomus riparius was determined through molecular cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The expression of ADH was then analyzed during different life-cycle developmental stages and under various DEHP concentrations. In addition, a comparative and phylogenetic study among different orders of insects and vertebrates was conducted through analysis of sequence databases. The complete cDNA sequence of the ADH gene was 1134 bp in length. The amino acid sequence of C. riparius ADH was found to have a low degree of homology (around 70%) with other insects available in the databases. ADH mRNA was highly expressed during various developmental stages. ADH gene expression by C. riparius increased significantly after short-term exposure (24 h) to DEHP, regardless of the exposure concentration. ADH gene expression also increased in C. riparius following exposure to DEHP for 7 days. These results suggest that DEHP affects the metabolism associated with ADH in Chironomus species.
