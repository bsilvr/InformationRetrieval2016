Use of acetaldehyde and methanol as markers of alcohol abuse and their measurement.It is believed that ethanol metabolites (ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetate) are produced when alcohol is consumed in accumulation with the binding of biological components. Additionally, it has been reported that ethanol metabolites and methanol present in the blood and urine are bound to biological components in habitual alcohol drinkers, even when alcohol has not been consumed. Consequently, with the purpose of investigating the potential for effectively using ethanol metabolite and methanol as markers of alcohol abuse, acetaldehyde level was measured in blood hemoglobin samples, and ethanol, acetaldehyde and methanol levels were measured in urine samples in healthy adult males (volunteers: control group) and alcoholics that had not consumed alcohol. Simultaneously, investigations were carried out on the genetic analysis of ADH and ALDH enzymes that participate in ethanol metabolism. Acetaldehyde levels were found to be significantly higher in alcoholics than in the volunteers for the period of 2 to 3 months after admission. In urine samples, acetaldehyde level (bound) was significantly higher in the period of 2 to 3 months after admission, and methanol level (free and bound) was significantly higher within a period of 1 month after admission. A correlation between alcoholics and genotype was found with regard to the distribution of ADH2 and ALDH2 genotypes (Volunteers: ADH2 2-2 type, 81%; ALDH2 1-1 type, 61.9%; Alcoholics: ADH2 2-2 type, 39.6%; ALDH2 1-1 type, 84.9%). Based on these results, alcoholism or alcohol abuse might be predicted by concentration of acetaldehyde as well as methanol during abstinence. It also might be used as markers of alcohol abuse.
