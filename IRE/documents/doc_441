Enzyme-modified nanoporous gold-based electrochemical biosensors.On the basis of the unique physical and chemical properties of nanoporous gold (NPG), which was obtained simply by dealloying Ag from Au/Ag alloy, an attempt was made in the present study to develop NPG-based electrochemical biosensors. The NPG-modified glassy carbon electrode (NPG/GCE) exhibited high-electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), which resulted in a remarkable decrease in the overpotential of NADH and H(2)O(2) electro-oxidation when compared with the gold sheet electrode. The high density of edge-plane-like defective sites and large specific surface area of NPG should be responsible for the electrocatalytic behavior. Such electrocatalytic behavior of the NPG/GCE permitted effective low-potential amperometric biosensing of ethanol or glucose via the incorporation of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) or glucose oxidase (GOD) within the three-dimensional matrix of NPG. The ADH- and GOD-modified NPG-based biosensors showed good analytical performance for biosensing ethanol and glucose due to the clean, reproducible and uniformly distributed microstructure of NPG. The stabilization effect of NPG on the incorporated enzymes also made the constructed biosensors very stable. After 1 month storage at 4 degrees C, the ADH- and GOD-based biosensors lost only 5.0% and 4.2% of the original current response. All these indicated that NPG was a promising electrode material for biosensors construction.
