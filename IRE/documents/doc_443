Effect of salt on the formation of alcohol-dehydrogenease monolayer: a study by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique.We report here the effect of salt (KCl) on the interfacial surface activity of yeast alcohol dehydogenease (ADH) at air/water interface using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. Effect of salt content in the water subphase on ADH structure has been studied. The change of area/molecule, compressibility, rigidity, and unfolding of ADH are insignificant up to 10 mM KCl concentration. The significant changes are observed above 0.1 M KCl concentrations. Observations are explained in the context of DLVO theory. FTIR study of amide band together with AFM imaging of ADH monolayer indicate that KCl perturbs the ADH monolayer by the increment of beta-structure resulting into larger unfolding and intermolecular aggregates at high salt concentration.
