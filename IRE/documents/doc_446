A novel assay for rapid in vivo determination of phenotypic stability of recombinant ethanol-producing microorganisms.A rapid empirical assay is presented for assessing the phenotypic stability of continuous cultures of recombinant bacteria containing transposed pdc and adh genes for ethanol production. The method measures spectrophotometrically the rate of colour formation when cells oxidize added ethanol to acetaldehyde in the presence of Schiff's reagent. During chemostat cultures of the recombinant ethanologen Escherichia coli KO11 on 20 g/l glucose, assay activities were stable and high at ca 8 x 10(-4) DeltaOD(540)/(s.OD(550)), reflecting the high, stable ethanol yield (ca 95%). On 20 g/l and 50 g/l xylose, ethanol yields declined rapidly to about 60% and this was closely mirrored by the assay activities which fell to ca 1.5 DeltaOD(540)/(s.OD(550)), only slightly higher than those measured for the parent strain. Typically taking only about an hour to perform, the assay provides a faster means of gauging the phenotypic stability of ethanol production than is possible by conventional methods.
