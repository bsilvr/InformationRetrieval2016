Quantification of the expression of reference and alcohol dehydrogenase genes of some acetic acid bacteria in different growth conditions.AIMS: The aim of this study was to develop a reliable system to analyse the expression of the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and test its ability to predict the growth and oxidative activity of some acetic acid bacteria (AAB). METHODS AND RESULTS: Specific primers were designed for use in RT-PCR to quantify ADH expression and several housekeeping genes in four species of AAB. 16S rRNA gene was selected as an internal control. The relative expression of adhA was measured in Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Gluconacetobacter hansenii and Gluconobacter oxydans grown in two media that had glucose or ethanol as the carbon source. AAB adhA expression was shown to be related to the two Acetobacter species' ability to oxidise and grow on ethanol, whereas G. oxydans were unable to grow on ethanol and the growth of Ga. hansenii was not related to adhA expression. CONCLUSIONS: The differential expression of ADH could be a marker to analyse both growth and oxidation ability in some AAB, especially those of the genus Acetobacter. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Several housekeeping genes were tested in AAB and after growth in different media and it was evident that only the ribosomal coding genes were adequate as reference genes for RT-PCR.
