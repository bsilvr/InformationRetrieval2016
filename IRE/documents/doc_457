Effects of a hexane extract from Laurus novocanariensis leaves on the ethanol metabolism of Wistar rats.A hexane extract from the leaves of Laurus novocanariensis was investigated for its activity on ethanol metabolism in Wistar rats. The extract could interfere with blood ethanol elevation, the induction of gastric alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the reduction of erythrocyte catalase (CAT). The sesquiterpene lactones dehydrocostus lactone and costunolide were identified in the active extract, and might represent its active constituents. These results support the use of L. novocanariensis in the traditional Madeira Island medicine to protect against ethanol injury.
