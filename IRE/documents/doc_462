Sulfolobus tokodaii ST0053 produces a novel thermostable, NAD-dependent medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase.An alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene, ST0053, from Sulfolobus tokodaii was expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme was an NAD-dependent medium-chain ADH with high thermostability and tolerance of a wide range of pHs. This is the first step in creating an experimental functionality library of 10 genes annotated as ADHs in the S. tokodaii genome.
