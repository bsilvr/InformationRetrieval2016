Cloning, expression, and characterization of a novel (S)-specific alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus kefir.A gene encoding a novel (S)-specific NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (LK-ADH) was isolated from the genomic DNA of Lactobacillus kefir DSM 20587 by thermal asymmetric interlaced-polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequence of (S)-LK-ADH gene (adhS) was determined, which consists of an open reading frame of 1,044 bp, coding for 347 amino acids with a molecular mass of 37.065 kDa. After a BLAST similarity search in GenBank database, the amino acid sequence of (S)-LK-ADH showed some homologies to several zinc containing medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenases. This novel gene was deposited into GenBank with the accession number of EU877965. adhS gene was subcloned into plasmid pET-28a(+), and recombinant (S)-LK-ADH was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) by isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside induction. Purified enzyme showed a high enantioselectivity in the reduction of acetophenone to (S)-phenylethanol with an ee value of 99.4%. The substrate specificity and cofactor preference of recombinant (S)-LK-ADH were also tested.
