[Alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase in malignant diseases--Part II]Heavy alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk of cancers including digestive tract, liver, pancreas, colorectum and breast. Direct correlations between alcohol consumption and development of cancer are still unknown. The differences in activities of ADH and ALDH between cancer tissues and normal mucosa might be a factor for metabolic changes and disturbances in low- mature cancer cells, might be a reason for the high level of acetaldehyde and intensifying carcinogenesis. Moreover releasing ADH and ALDH from cancer cells can cause increase of these enzymes activities in the sera of patients with cancer.
