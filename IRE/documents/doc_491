Tissue expression pattern of class II and class V genes found in the Adh complex on mouse chromosome 3.The alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes in mice and humans are encoded by a linked group of genes in the same transcriptional orientation. The enzymes play important roles in alcohol metabolism and retinoid signaling and homeostasis. The expression patterns at the mRNA level of the mouse Adh4 (class II) gene and the recently identified Adh6a and Adh6b genes (class V) are now reported to complete this analysis for the entire family. Adh4 is expressed at high levels in liver and is detectable in small intestine and testes. Adh6b is expressed in liver but Adh6a is not. Adh6a is expressed at high levels in small intestine while Adh6b is not. Adh6a expression is detectable in the female adrenal and not at all in the male adrenal, but Adh6b is expressed at moderate levels in both sexes. Although Adh6a and Adh6b have expression patterns different from each other, neither expresses like any other gene in the complex, suggesting different control mechanisms and possibly different functions.
