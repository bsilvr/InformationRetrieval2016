Antidiuretic hormone. Normal and disordered function.In humans and most other mammals, the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a nonapeptide often referred to as arginine vasopressin (AVP). It is produced by large neurons that originate in the supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and project through the pituitary stalk to terminate on capillary plexuses scattered throughout the posterior pituitary. These plexuses drain into the systemic circulation by way of the cavernous sinus and superior vena cava.
