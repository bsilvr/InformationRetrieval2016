Central mu opioids mediate differential control of urine flow rate and urinary sodium excretion in conscious rats.Central administration of the selective mu opioid agonist, dermorphin, produces a concurrent diuretic and antinatriuretic response in conscious rats. To determine whether central mu opioids differentially affect the renal excretion of water and sodium, we examined changes in renal function produced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of dermorphin during continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion of a synthetic ADH analogue in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats. During ADH infusion the typical diuresis produced by i.c.v. dermorphin was abolished although the antinatriuresis remained intact. Alone, i.v. ADH produced a decrease in urine flow rate without significantly altering urinary sodium excretion. In other studies, the effects of i.c.v. dermorphin were examined on the renal responses produced by i.v. infusion of a V2-ADH receptor antagonist. In these studies the magnitude of the V2 antagonist-induced diuresis was not altered by i.c.v. dermorphin but the increase in urinary sodium excretion produced by this antagonist was converted to an antinatriuresis. Central dermorphin did not alter heart rate or mean arterial pressure in either study. These findings suggest that the effects of central dermorphin on renal sodium and water handling are mediated by separate mechanisms; the effects on water involving changes in circulating ADH levels and the effects on sodium independent of the action of this hormone.
