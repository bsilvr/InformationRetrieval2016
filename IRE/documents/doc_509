Antidiuretic response in the urinary bladder of Xenopus laevis: presence of typical aggrephores and apical aggregates.The urinary bladder of the aquatic toad Xenopus laevis is known to exhibit a low permeability to water and a poor sensitivity to antidiuretic hormone. In order to precise the characteristics and the specific cellular mechanisms of this reduced hydro-osmotic response we used a sensitive volumetric technique to monitor net water flow and studied the correlation between the antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-induced net water flow and the fine ultrastructural appearance of the urinary bladder epithelium. Transmural net water flow was entirely dependent on the osmotic gradient across the preparation and not on the hydrostatic pressure difference. We observed the existence of a low but significant hydro-osmotic response to arginine vasopressin. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of typical aggrephores in the subapical cytoplasm. The response to the hormone was accompanied by the appearance of typical intramembrane aggregates into the apical plasma membrane. Water permeability increase and apical aggregate insertion were both slowly but fully reversible. Except for the multilayered structure of the epithelium and the particularly low response to antidiuretic hormone, all the studied permeability and ultrastructural characteristics of the bladder were thus very similar to those observed in other sensitive epithelia such as the amphibian bladder and skin and the mammalian collecting duct which exhibit a high hydro-osmotic response to the hormone.
