Transepithelial water movement in response to carbamazepine, chlorpropamide and demeclocycline in toad urinary bladder.1. Osmotic water movement across toad isolated hemibladders was measured by a gravimetric method. 2. The influence of carbamazepine, chlorpropamide and demeclocycline on the antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-induced water flow rate was examined. 3. No antidiuretic activity due to carbamazepine alone was observed but a slight inhibition due to ADH-induced water flow was observed in the presence of carbamazepine over a selected dose-range. This was unexpected and is inconsistent with data from in vivo studies in man. 4. Chlorpropamide potentiated ADH-induced water flow, in keeping with the hypothesis that chlorpropamide sensitizes the renal tubules to ADH-induced water flow. 5. Demeclocycline inhibited ADH-induced water flow. The mechanism of action remains unclear.
