The effect of angiotensin II and ADH on the secretion of atrial natriuretic factor.Studies in intact animals have suggested that angiotensin II (AII) and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increase the plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). The purpose of these studies was to examine the effects of AII and ADH on ANF secretion in a rat heart-lung preparation under conditions where aortic pressure could be regulated and other indirect effects of these hormones eliminated. ANF secretion was estimated as the total amount of ANF present in a perfusion reservoir at the end of each 30-min period. A pump was used to deliver a fluorocarbon perfusate to the right atrium at rates of either 2 or 5 ml/min. In a time control series where venous return was maintained at 2 ml/min for three 30-min periods ANF secretion was 672 +/- 114, 794 +/- 91, and 793 +/- 125 pg/min (n = 6, P greater than 0.05). When venous return was increased from 2 to 5 ml/min ANF secretion increased from 669 +/- 81 to 1089 +/- 127 pg/min (P less than 0.01). The addition of AII to the perfusate in concentrations of 50, 100, or 200 pg/ml (n = 6 in each group) had no significant effect on basal ANF secretion or the ANF response to increasing venous return. Similarly, the addition of ADH to the perfusate in concentrations of 5, 25, or 100 pg/ml had no significant effect on ANF release from the heart. These results suggest that the ability of AII and ADH to increase plasma ANF concentration in vivo may be due to the effects of these hormones on right or left atrial pressure.
