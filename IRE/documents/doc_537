Effect of acetylsalicylic acid on urinary excretion of prostaglandin E in stroke patients.In 12 of 76 stroke patients complicated by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), a significant increase in urinary prostaglandin E (PGE) (p less than 0.005), and a significant positive relationship between the plasma arginine vasopressin (AVR) level and urinary PGE excretion were observed (r = 0.72, p less than 0.05). The experimental results are consistent with the view that renal PGE acts as a modulator of ADH. Nowadays acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), an inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis, is widely used in ischemic stroke, it was felt necessary to study the effect of this drug on urinary PGE excretion. Therefore various daily doses of ASA were given orally for 3 days to patients with ischemic stroke. PGE values in 24-hour urine samples were measured every day for 3 days before administration of the drug and for 3 days during ASA administration. In 10 patients who took 75 mg of ASA, the decrease in urinary PGE excretion was not statistically significant. On the other hand when ASA was administered 300 mg once in 19 patients or 300 mg 4 times in 11 cases, urinary PGE excretion decreased significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively). In another group of 8 patients who were observed before, during and after the ASA administration, a daily oral dose of 300 mg for 3 days caused a significant decrease in urinary PGE excretion during these 3 days (p less than 0.05). The urinary PGE excretion returned to the control level within 3 days after cessation of the ASA administration.
