Release of tissue kallikrein from the isolated perfused kidney.Experiments were designed to determine the action of regulatory peptides and potassium on the secretion of tissue kallikrein by the isolated perfused rat kidney. Such experiments indicated that in spite of the directly evoked release of kallikrein by arginine-vasopressin (AVP, ADH), oxytocin and potassium from isolated renal cortical slices, the secretion and clearance of active and total tissue kallikrein by the isolated kidney was primarily sensitive to changes in the perfusion pressure.
