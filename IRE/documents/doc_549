Lesions of the tissue surrounding the preoptic recess (AV3V region) affect neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular nuclei in the rat.Lesions of the tissue surrounding the preoptic recess (AV3V region) have severe effects on body fluid homeostasis; these include acute adipsia and failure of the antidiuretic response. Because neurosecretory cells in supraoptic nuclei comprise the major source of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in this species, we have previously observed the fine structure of supraoptic nuclei in rats with AV3V lesions. Paraventricular nuclei are the other major source of ADH in rats. Therefore, in this investigation we compared the fine structure of paraventricular nuclei in rats which had received AV3V lesions 3 days earlier with that of control rats which had received sham lesions and either had drinking water available or had water withheld for 3 days. Degenerating axons and axon terminals were present in paraventricular nuclei of lesioned rats. The degenerating terminals were in axodendritic and less often in axosomatic synapses. Morphometric evaluation revealed that neurosecretory cells did respond to the dehydrated state of the adipsic-lesioned animals, but the response was significantly attenuated compared to that which occurred in sham-lesioned rats deprived of water for 3 days. It appears that AV3V lesions damage afferent connections and impair the response of neurosecretory cells to dehydration in paraventricular as well as supraoptic nuclei. However, in paraventricular nuclei the response is not completely prevented by AV3V lesions during the adipsic period as was observed in supraoptic nuclei. The presence of a response in paraventricular nuclei may be at least partially stimulated by reduced body fluid volume. Information from volume receptors would be carried from the medulla to paraventricular nuclei by ascending pathways which are not affected by AV3V lesions.
