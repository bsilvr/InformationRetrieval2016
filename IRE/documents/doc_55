Amino Acid-based peritoneal dialysis solutions for malnutrition: new perspectives.Protein and energy malnutrition is frequently found in patients on maintenance dialysis and is associated with an increased risk of death. Among a variety of factors involved in the development of protein and energy malnutrition, such as acidosis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and dialysate protein losses, insufficient intake of proteins and energy as a result of anorexia plays a prominent role. Amino acid (AA)-based peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions can induce an anabolic response in malnourished patients on continuous ambulatory PD if enough calories are ingested simultaneously. Poor appetite, however, may impede the intake of sufficient calories. Peritoneal dialysis solutions containing a mixture of AAs and glucose in a proper ratio can serve as a source of proteins and calories. Such a dialysis solution can be used in fasting patients on nocturnal automated PD as part of a regular dialysis schedule. Using a sophisticated technique involving stable isotopes, this dialysis mixture has been found to induce acute anabolic changes in whole body protein metabolism. Such a metabolic response is similar to that induced by food. Intraperitoneal AAs, in common with ingested proteins, can induce generation of hydrogen ions and urea through oxidation of specific AAs. Supplying AAs together with calories could bring about utilization of AAs for the synthesis of proteins rather than the oxidation of AAs, thereby limiting production of acid and urea. Using dialysis solutions with a buffer concentration of 40 mmol/L further contributes to maintaining acid-base homeostasis. We advocate consideration of usage of AA/glucose dialysate when PD patients cannot comply with dietary requirements. To evaluate the long-term effects of this approach on morbidity and mortality, clinical trials with large groups of patients are needed.
