Sustained response to vasopressin in isolated rat cortical collecting tubule.The effect of arginine vasopressin (ADH) on water permeability and transepithelial voltage was examined in cortical collecting tubules from a specific pathogen-free line of male Sprague-Dawley rats (75-125 g body weight). Tubules were bathed in a medium resembling serum ultrafiltrate (310 mOsm/kg H2O) at 38 degrees C. Osmotic water permeability (Pf, micron/sec) was determined by the volume flow occurring with a hypo-osmotic perfusate (210-220 mOsm/kg H2O) and diffusional water permeability (Pd, micron/sec) was calculated from the lumen-to-bath flux of tritiated water using an isosmotic perfusate. In the absence of ADH, both Pf and Pd were low, 17 +/- 6 and 9.0 +/- 0.6 (SEM), respectively. ADH added to the bath at concentrations above 0.5 microunits/ml increased Pf, with a maximal response at 40 microunits/ml or greater. With 100 microunits/ml ADH, Pf and Pd were, respectively, 994 +/- 117 and 37.0 +/- 2.4. Without ADH, the transepithelial voltage was variable (range, -5.4 to +2.5 mV; mean, -1.9 +/- 0.4); however, with 100 microU/ml ADH, it hyperpolarized (lumen-negative) by 4.2 +/- 0.8 mV. In contrast to findings in the rabbit, both the hyperpolarization and the increased water permeability persisted for at least 3 hr. The higher water permeabilities are consistent with the shorter length of the cortical collecting tubule in the rat, and may reflect the importance of attaining osmotic equilibration within the cortex during maximal antidiuresis.
