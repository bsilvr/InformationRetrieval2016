Evidence that renal prostaglandins are involved in renal water metabolism in cirrhosis.Plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion (UPGE2V) were measured in basal conditions, after water restriction, and after water-loading in 10 normal subjects (free water clearance after the water load, CH2O, 9.6 +/- 0.8 ml/min) and in 27 patients with cirrhosis and ascites (13 with a positive CH2O: 3.6 +/- 0.5; 14 with a negative CH2O: -0.37 +/- 0.007). Plasma ADH and UPGE2V were significantly increased in patients with a positive CH2O as compared with normal subjects. Patients with a negative CH2O showed a significantly higher plasma ADH and a lower UPGE2V and GFR than did normal subjects and patients with the positive CH2O. In 18 additional subjects (6 normal and 12 with cirrhosis, ascites, and a positive CH2O) submitted to a sustained water overload, the i.v. administration of 450 mg of lysine acetylsalicylate (LAS) induced a marked reduction of UPGE2V, but it had no effect on plasma ADH. LAS did not alter GFR and CH2O in normal subjects; however, it reduced CH2O in all the 12 patients (from 5.1 +/- 0.4 to 0.6 +/- 0.3) and the GFR in only 6 of these patients. These results suggest (a) that renal PGE2 plays an important role in the maintenance of water excretion in cirrhosis with ascites, and (b) that impaired ability to dilute the urine in cirrhosis may be a consequence of the simultaneous occurrence of impaired renal hemodynamics, nonostomic hypersecretion of ADH, and reduced renal production of PGE2.
