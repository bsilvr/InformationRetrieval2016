Renin-aldosterone axis in ethanol intoxication: effect of an ADH analogue (desaminocys1-D-arg8-vasopressin, DDAVP).Plasma renin activity (PRA) is stimulated and renin-aldosterone nexus is broken in acute ethanol intoxication. Serial changes in renin-aldosterone axis were studied in five healthy males during moderate ethanol intoxication, while alcohol diuresis was prevented by 20 micrograms of an antidiuretic hormone analogue, desaminocys1-D-arg8-vasopressin (DDAVP), administered intranasally. The experiment was performed with the subject supine, and the amount of ethanol taken p.o., at a steady rate in 90 min, was 1.2 g/kg body weight, diluted with juice to 20 vol% solution. DDAVP prevented the stimulation of PRA, suggesting that dehydration due to alcohol diuresis is the main reason for this phenomenon during ethanol intoxication. However, there still was a dissociation between PRA and aldosterone, which may be caused by increased serum Na+/K+ ratio or an inhibitory action of ethanol on aldosterone secretion.
