Mechanism of increased renin release in the adrenalectomized rat. Adrenal insufficiency and renin.We have previously suggested that inhibition of renin release by sodium chloride is related to absorptive chloride transport in the loop of Henle. Infusion of sodium chloride fails to inhibit renin release in the adrenalectomized (Adx) rat, and dexamethasone restores renin responsiveness to sodium chloride. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between loop function (urinary diluting and concentration capacity) and plasma renin concentration (PRC) in the Adx rat. After hypotonic sodium chloride infusion, free water clearance (CH2O) of Adx rats (0.56 ml/hr/100 g +/- 0.17 SE) was decreased (p less than 0.01) compared to controls (2.86 ml/hr/100 g +/- 0.29 SE); PRC of Adx rats (61.9 units/ml +/- 11.2 SE) was increased (p less than 0.01) above controls (6.0 units/ml +/- 1.7 SE). These differences persisted after administration of d(CH2)5Tyr(Et)VAVP, a potent ADH antagonist. In separate groups of animals, after water deprivation, urine concentration of Adx rat (1,401 mOsm/kg +/- 45 SE) was less (p less than 0.01) than that of controls (2,117 mOsm/kg +/- 169 SE). Dexamethasone normalized both CH2O and urinary concentrating ability and also decreased PRC in Adx rats. Thus, in the glucocorticoid deficient rat, increased renin release is associated with impaired loop function. The loop defect may account for high PRC that is not suppressed by sodium chloride.
