Stimulation by antidiuretic hormone of electrolyte tubular reabsorption in rat kidney.The effects of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) on renal excretion and tubular transport of water and electrolytes were investigated in homozygous DI Brattleboro rats. To ascertain these effects on the loop of Henle, circulating glucagon, parathyroid hormone, and thyrocalcitonin were reduced before the experiments, as these hormones are believed to stimulate the same cells of the thick ascending limb as ADH. dDAVP did not alter either glomerular or proximal tubular functions. In the loop, it consistently raised reabsorption of Mg, Ca, K, and, to a lesser extent, Na and Cl, but phosphate transport was not affected. dDAVP lowered the urinary excretion rates for Mg, Ca, K, Cl, and total solutes. For Mg, this reduction was independent of the drop in the urinary flow rate following dDAVP administration but was significantly correlated to this drop in the case of Ca, K, Cl, and total solutes. Na and P excretions were not altered by dDAVP. It is concluded that, in vivo, administration of ADH 1) stimulates reabsorption of Na, Cl, Mg, Ca, and K by the thick ascending limb, 2) consistently enhances Mg reabsorption by the whole kidney by enhancing reabsorption in the loop of Henle, and 3) at maximal antidiuresis, raises Ca, K, Cl, and total solute reabsorption, probably because of the drop in tubular flow rates in the distal parts of the nephron consequent to the hormone administration.
