1-deamino-/4-valine-8-D-arginine/-vasopressin (dVDAVP), a new synthetic vasopressin analog for treating diabetes insipidus.The effects of LVP, dDAVP, and dVDAVP on the water excretion of 14 vasopressin-sensitive and 2 ADH-resistant patients with diabetes insipidus were studied and compared. Findings showed that dDAVP and dVDAVP decreased the diuresis of all ADH-sensitive patients, and in those with diabetes insipidus, more markedly (7.6-fold) and for a longer duration (3.3-fold) than did LVP. From a comparison of the results, dVDAVP is at present one of the most effective preparations for reduction of polyuria in patients with ADH-sensitive diabetes insipidus.
