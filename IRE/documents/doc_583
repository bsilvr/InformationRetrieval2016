The effect of antidiuretic hormone, indomethacin and naproxen on prostaglandin synthesis of experimentally infected and healthy kidneys.The authors studied the effect of indomethacin and naproxen on the changes of renal prostaglandin E and F2 alpha concentration in experimental kidney infection, as well as the action of arginine-vasopressin in healthy rats. Naproxen proved to be an effective inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, as did indomethacin. In control animals an increased prostaglandin E and F2 alpha synthesis was observed caused by arginine vasopressin. It is supposed that ADH--depending on its concentration--has a metabolic modulator role in prostaglandin synthesis, which raises the possibility of a self-regulatory mechanism of water reabsorption.
