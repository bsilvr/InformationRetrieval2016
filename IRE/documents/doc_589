Temperature effect on ADH response of isolated perfused rabbit collecting tubules.The time course of the water permeability response to synthetic arginine vasopressin (AVP) was examined in isolated perfused rabbit collecting tubules. When experiments were conducted at 37 degrees C, addition of AVP in a concentration of 100 microU/ml increased hydraulic water permeability (Lp) from 18 +/- 4 X 10(-7) to 153 +/- 15 X 10(-7) cm x s-1 x atm-1. However, in contrast to results obtained at 25 degrees C, the Lp immediately decreased in spite of the continued presence of AVP, reaching half the peak value in 67 +/- 6 (SE) min. A similar decline was observed at 37 degrees C when a cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate analogue was added to the bathing medium. Corticosteroids greatly enhanced the peak water absorption but did not stabilize the subsequent response to AVP at 37 degrees C. A decline in diffusional water permeability measured in the absence of a transtubule osmotic gradient excluded the possible roles of cellular hypotonicity, increased cell volume, or osmotic water absorption in the unstable response to hormone. The peritubular membrane remained highly permeable to water, independent of AVP and temperature. Duration of exposure to 37 degrees C was more important than AVP in determining the unstable response. On the basis of these studies we conclude that isolated rabbit cortical collecting tubules progressively become insensitive to AVP at 37 degrees C, possibly due to alterations in the responsiveness of the urinary plasma membrane to cAMP.
