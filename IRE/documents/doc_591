Radioimmunoassay of arginine vasopressin in human plasma and urine, a resin microcolumn method.A new method was developed for the estimation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in plasma and urine. Samples were extracted by a microcolumn of resin and assayed radioimmunologically using a highly sensitive antiserum to AVP. Ion-exchange resin, CG-50, H+ form, packed in a small column (diameter 4 mm, height 6 mm), was proved effective to remove the interfering substances and to concentrate the AVP in the sample. The application of 80% acid acetone successive to diluted HCl brought about a consistent recovery of AVP from the resin column. Recoveries were 66.4 +/- 8.5% for plasma and 85.4 +/- 9.7% for urine. In normal subjects plasma AVP levels were 3.9 +/  0.3 pg/ml (mean +/- S.D.) in ambulatory states, 4.9 +/- ).6 after overnight fast, and 0.4 +/- 0.2 after water lading. High levels of 2.0 +/- 24.2 pg/ml were obtained in patinents with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH), low values of 0-1.8 pg/ml in diabetes inipidus. Urinary excretions of AVP were 117.4 +/- 59.4 ng/24/hr (mean +/- S.D.) in normal controls, 191 +/- 177.0/24 hr in SIADH, and 17.0 +/- 12.0/24 hr in diabetes insipidus.
