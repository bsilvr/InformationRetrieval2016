When is weaker better? Design of an ADP sensor with weak ADP affinity, but still selective against ATP.A simple ADP biosensor would be of broad usefulness in monitoring the large number of metabolic processes that produce ADP. Several new systems have been recently described including one in the current issue of ACS Chemical Biology that provides a simple readout of the ADP concentration without significant interference by ATP.
