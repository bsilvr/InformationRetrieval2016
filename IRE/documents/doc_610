Out-of-equilibrium conformational cycling of GroEL under saturating ATP concentrations.The molecular chaperone GroEL exists in at least two allosteric states, T and R, that interconvert in an ATP-controlled manner. Thermodynamic analysis suggests that the T-state population becomes negligible with increasing ATP concentrations, in conflict with the requirement for conformational cycling, which is essential for the operation of molecular machines. To solve this conundrum, we performed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on the single-ring version of GroEL, using a fluorescent switch recently built into its structure, which turns  on,  i.e., increases its fluorescence dramatically, when ATP is added. A series of correlation functions was measured as a function of ATP concentration and analyzed using singular-value decomposition. The analysis assigned the signal to two states whose dynamics clearly differ. Surprisingly, even at ATP saturation, approximately 50% of the molecules still populate the T state at any instance of time, indicating constant out-of-equilibrium cycling between T and R. Only upon addition of the cochaperonin GroES does the T-state population vanish. Our results suggest a model in which the T/R ratio is controlled by the rate of ADP release after hydrolysis, which can be determined accordingly.
