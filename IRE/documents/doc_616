[Dose-effect relationship of traditional Chinese medicine formula for promoting blood circulation to remove stasis on ADP-induced platelet aggregation and rabbit plasma thrombin time]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of five traditional Chinese medicine formula for promoting blood circulation to remove stasis (Xuefuzhuyu Tang, Shaofuzhuyu Tang, Gexiazhuyu Tang, ShentongZhuyu Tang, Tongqiaohuoxue Tang) on platelet aggregation and clotting time in a dose-response relationship. METHOD: The platelet aggregation was tested with Born's method and thrombin time (TT) method was established to determine the clotting time. RESULT: The formula for promoting blood circulation to remove stasis showed significant inhibitory effects on the platelet aggregation and prolonged clotting time, the supernate of 80% alcohol solution showed the most potent inhibitory activity among the three kinds of samples from one formula (P &lt; 0.01), especially the supernate of Shaofuzhuyu Tang and Gexiazhuyu Tang were better than other formula on platelet aggregation. About the anticoagulant, the whole formula showed the evidently prolonging the clotting time than other two fractions (P &lt; 0.01) and the precipitation were the worst. CONCLUSION: The formula for promoting blood circulation to remove stasis showed significant effect on platelet aggregation and clotting time, and different samples of the formula had different efficacy. The study established a foundation for further bio-activity evaluation of these formulae and provided evidence for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
