Trichomonas vaginalis: dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and 17beta-estradiol alter NTPDase activity and gene expression.We investigated the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and 17beta-estradiol on NTPDase activity in fresh clinical (VP60) and long-term-grown (30236 ATCC) isolates of Trichomonas vaginalis followed by NTPDase gene transcriptional analysis. ATP hydrolysis was activated in vitro by 17beta-estradiol (0.01-1.0microM) in the VP60 isolate. Treatment for 2h with 17beta-estradiol (0.01-1microM) promoted an inhibition in nucleotide hydrolysis in the 30236 isolate whereas the 12h-treatment promoted an activation of nucleotide hydrolysis in both isolates. ADP hydrolysis was inhibited in vitro by 1.0-5.0microM DHEAS in the ATCC isolate. The treatment with DHEAS (0.01-1.0microM) for 2h inhibited ATP and ADP hydrolysis in VP60; however, during a 12h-treatment with DHEAS, nucleotide hydrolysis was inhibited in both isolates. Two NTPDase orthologous (NTPDaseA and NTPDaseB) were identified and the treatment with DHEAS for 12h was able to inhibit mRNA NTPDaseA transcript levels from the VP60. These findings demonstrate that NTPDase activity and gene expression pattern are modulated by exposure to steroids in T. vaginalis.
