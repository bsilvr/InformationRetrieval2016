ADP-Glo: A Bioluminescent and homogeneous ADP monitoring assay for kinases.ADP-Glo is a novel bioluminescent, homogeneous assay for monitoring ADP producing biochemical reactions and thus it is an ideal assay for detecting enzyme activity using a wide variety of substrates. It is a universal assay that can be used with protein kinases, lipid kinases, sugar kinases, and many more kinases as well as ATPases. Because of its high sensitivity, it is suitable for monitoring enzyme activities at very early substrate conversions requiring very low amount of enzymes. Furthermore, as the assay is applicable to a broad range of ATP and substrate concentrations, it is optimal for enzymes that require high ATP and substrate concentrations. This is critical since inhibitor potency has to be demonstrated at the cellular level where ATP is present at millimolar concentrations. ADP-Glo is performed in 2 steps upon completion of kinase reaction: a combined termination of kinase reaction and depletion of remaining ATP in the first step, and conversion of generated ADP to ATP and the newly produced ATP to light output using luciferase/luciferin reaction in the second step. The luminescent signal generated is proportional to the ADP concentration produced and is correlated with the kinase activity. Due to its high signal to background and luminescent readout, this assay is less susceptible to generation of false hits and thus it is applicable to not only primary and secondary screening but also kinase profiling.
