Iron transport by proteoliposomes containing mitochondrial F(1)F(0) ATP synthase isolated from rat heart.In this work, we present evidence of Fe(2+) transport by rat heart mitochondrial F(1)F(0) ATP synthase. Iron uptake by the vesicles containing the enzyme was concentration- and temperature-dependent, with an optimum temperature of 37 degrees C. Both ATP and ADP stimulated iron uptake in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas AMP, AMPPCP, and mADP did not. Inhibitors of the enzyme, oligomycin, and resveratrol similarly blocked iron transport. The iron uptake was confirmed by inhibition using specific antibodies against the alpha, beta, and c subunits of the enzyme. Interestingly, slight transport of common divalent and trivalent metal ions such as Mg(+2), Ca(+2), Mn(+2), Zn(+2), Cu(+2), Fe(+3), and Al(+3) was observed. Moreover, Cu(+2), even in the nM range, inhibited iron uptake and attained maximum inhibition of approximately 56%. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the medium exerted an opposite effect depending on the type of adenosine nucleotide, which was suppressed with ATP, but enhanced with ADP. A similarly stimulating effect of ATP and ADP with an inverse effect of Pi suggests that the activity of ATPase and ATP synthase may be associated with iron uptake in a different manner, probably via antiport of H(+).
