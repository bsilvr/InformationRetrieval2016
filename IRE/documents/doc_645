[Effect of cytoflavine on bioenergetic processes in the liver after severe limb compression trauma]The experiments on rats showed that severe compression trauma of limb muscles leads to a decrease in the energetic potential of the liver. Cytoflavine injected in rats with model traumas increased the content of ATP and cAMP and decreased the level of ADP and AMP, thus recovering the energetic potential of adenine nucleotides in the liver.
