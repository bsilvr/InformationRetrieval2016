Evaluating the utility of a bioluminescent ADP-detecting assay for lipid kinases.The lipid second messengers phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are well recognized to play important roles in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and migration. Disruption of lipid signaling pathways often leads to human cancers, making lipid kinases attractive drug targets. In order to develop novel drugs against these enzymes, an assay that monitors their activity and amenable to high-throughput scale for screening large number of compounds is essential. The newly developed ADP-Glo assay is such an assay that measures kinase activity of lipid kinases by detecting the formation of ADP using a highly robust and sensitive bioluminescence approach. We evaluated this technology for studying lipid kinases, class I PI3 kinases, and sphingosine kinases and we show that the assay exhibits good tolerance to different lipids substrates. It generates kinetic parameters for substrates and inhibitors similar to those reported in the literature using other published assay formats. The sensitivity and robustness of this assay allow the detection of 5% of substrate conversion with Z' values &gt;0.7 making it attractive for high-throughput screening (HTS) applications. It is noteworthy that ADP-Glo assay addresses the need for a single integrated platform to comprehensively measure all classes of lipid and protein kinases. The selected inhibitors of lipid kinases can be screened against the panel of desired protein kinases, making ADP-Glo assay a simple, inexpensive platform for HTS and profiling of lipid kinases.
