Pyruvate kinase in pig liver mitochondria.The existence of the pyruvate kinase (PK) in pig liver mitochondria was shown by monitoring photometrically the PK reaction in solubilised mitochondria with either phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or ADP used as a substrate. In distinction with the cytosolic isoenzyme, the mitochondrial PK showed a sigmoidal dependence on either PEP or ADP concentrations. The occurrence of the mitochondrial PK was confirmed by immunological analysis. Titration with digitonin showed that mPK is restricted to the matrix. PEP addition to mitochondria resulted in reduction of the intramitochondrial NAD(P)+ inhibited by either the non-penetrant thiol reagent mersalyl or by arsenite, an inhibitor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Citrate/oxaloacetate appearance outside mitochondria also occurred as result of PEP addition to PLM. Taken together these findings support a role for PEP itself in triggering fatty acid synthesis via its mitochondrial metabolism.
