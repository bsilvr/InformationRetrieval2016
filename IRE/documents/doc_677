Update on antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndromes: what do new drugs bring into clinical practice?The incidence of new coronary events in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (e.g. cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid; ASA]) and ADP receptor blockers (e.g. clopidogrel) is high. Therefore, it is critical to identify patients who require more intense treatment such as those with poor tolerance to existing drugs, those with genotypes that predict treatment resistance, diabetic patients, and smokers. The new ADP receptor blockers (prasugrel, cangrelor, Ticagrelor) can provide greater efficacy but it should not be associated with increased bleeding. Thrombin receptor antagonists (e.g. SCH530348) are another alternative that is currently being tested in randomized trials.
