A neuroprotective exercise protocol reduces the adenine nucleotide hydrolysis in hippocampal synaptosomes and serum of rats.Regular and moderate exercise has been considered as an interesting neuroprotective strategy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which physical exercise alters brain function are unclear. Purinergic signaling seems to modulate the pathophysiology of ischemic neuronal damage, since it has been described a neuroprotective activity of adenosine and a dual role of ATP. In the present study, we investigated the effect of daily moderate intensity exercise on ectonucleotidase activities in synaptosomes from hippocampus and the soluble nucleotidases from blood serum of rats. Adult male Wistar rats were assigned to non-exercised (sedentary) group and exercised during 20-min sessions on different programs. The effects of physical activity on hydrolysis of ATP, ADP and AMP were assayed in the synaptosomal fraction obtained from the hippocampus and serum approximately 16 h after the last training session. Our data demonstrated that a neuroprotective exercise protocol, daily 20 min of training in treadmill during 2 weeks, diminished significantly the ADP hydrolysis and there is a trend to reduce the ATP hydrolysis in both hippocampal synaptosomes and blood serum of rats. We suggest that the neuroprotective exercise protocol may modulate nucleotidase activities.
