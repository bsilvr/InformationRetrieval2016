[Antiaggregant properties of new 1,3,4-thiadiazine derivatives]A series of new 1,3,4-thiadiazine derivatives have been synthesized and their effect on the human platelet aggregation in vitro has been studied. All the tested substances inhibit the human platelet aggregation induced by ADP and arachidonic acid in a broad concentration range. The most active 1,3,4-thiadiazines (L-19, L-28 and L-31) effectively inhibit platelet aggregation at concentrations within 0.01-1 mM.
