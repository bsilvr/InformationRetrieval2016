Influence of human allogenic bone marrow and cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell secreting trophic factors on ATP (adenosine-5'-triphosphate)/ADP (adenosine-5'-diphosphate) ratio and insulin secretory function of isolated human islets from cadaveric donor.Successful islet transplantation (ITx) is not only dependent on the number of islets, but also their quality, including viability, metabolic activity, and function. Islet quality decreases during cultivation after the isolation procedure. To overcome this obstacle, we established the practice of islet and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) coculture. This coculture condition improved the ATP (adenosine-5'-triphosphate)/ADP (adenosine-5'-diphosphate) ratio and insulin secretory function in vitro. It is believed that the enhancement of islet quality in islet-MSCs cocultures may be caused by the secretion of active agents by MSCs. Herein we have shown that interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) were significantly increased as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in MSCs-cultured medium, factors that have been shown to improve the survival, function, and angiogenesis/revascularization of islets. These results indicated that the quality of human islets was enhanced by trophic molecules secreted by MSCs, which influence the intracellular islet ATP content and insulin secretory function.
