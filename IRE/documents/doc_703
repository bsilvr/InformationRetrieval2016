Automatic data processing equipment and services; conditions for federal financing participation--HCFA. Final Rule.In September 1978, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS-then the Department of Health, Education and Welfare) published a regulation containing requirements that State and local governments must observe to claim Federal reimbursement for the costs of automatic data processing (ADP) equipment or services. The regulations are applicable to certain public assistance programs under the Social Security Act. The regulations were modified in February 1980 and in January 1986 to implement certain changes. These regulations change requirements for the claiming of Federal matching funds for the acquisition of ADP equipment or services in the administration of public assistances programs under the Social Security Act Titles I, IV, X, XIV, (AABD), XXIX and XX. The change modifies the regulations to conform to legislative changes, raises the HHS prior approval threshold for most State and local government acquisitions, and limits the types of documents which are subject to prior approval requirements. The purpose of the change is to: Simplify and make these regulations consistent, to the maximum extent possible, with those regulations that govern availability of Federal Financial Participation (FFP) at the enhanced matching rate for computerized systems that support programs under Titles IV-A, IV-D, and XIX of the Social Security Act; Allow States more flexibility in implementing small systems; and reduce paperwork.
