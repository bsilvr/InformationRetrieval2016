Adrenergic responses to stress: transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes.Stress effects on adrenergic responses in rats were examined in adrenal medulla, the primary source of circulating epinephrine (Epi). Irrespective of duration, immobilization (IMMO) increased adrenal corticosterone to the same extent. In contrast, Epi changed little, suggesting that Epi synthesis replenishes adrenal pools and sustains circulating levels for the heightened alertness and physiological changes required of the  flight or fight  response. IMMO also induced the Epi-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). The rise in its mRNA and protein was preceded by increases in Egr-1 and Sp1 mRNA, protein, and protein-DNA binding complex formation. With repeated and prolonged stress, PNMT protein did not reflect the magnitude of change in mRNA. The latter suggests that post-transcriptional, in addition to transcriptional mechanisms, regulate PNMT responses to stress. To further reveal molecular mechanisms underlying stress-induced changes in adrenergic function, the effects of hypoxia on PNMT promoter-driven gene expression are being examined in adrenal medulla-derived PC12 cells. Hypoxia activates the PNMT promoter to increase PNMT promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene expression and endogenous PNMT in PC12 cells. Induction of both appear mediated via activation of multiple signaling pathways and downstream activation of hypoxia inducible factor and PNMT transcriptional activators, Egr-1 and Sp1. Hypoxia generates both partially and fully processed forms of PNMT mRNA. The former reportedly is translated into a truncated, nonfunctional protein, and the latter into enzymatically active PNMT. Together, findings suggest that stress increases PNMT gene transcriptional activity but post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms limit the biological end-point of functional PNMT enzyme and, thereby, Epi.
