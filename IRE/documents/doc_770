An electron microscopic study on nerve endings on adrenomedullary adrenaline cells in golden hamsters: position, size and changes due to pinealectomy.Effects of sham-pinealectomy and pinealectomy on preganglionic nerve endings on adrenomedullary adrenaline cells were investigated electron microscopically. Adult male golden hamsters from the normal, sham-pinealectomy and pinealectomy groups maintained under 24 h light-dark cycle and constant temperature were used at 28 days after surgery. From conventional electron microscopic specimens, montage photographs made of the adrenaline cell region at a magnification of x 11,000 were used for qualitative and quantitative electron microscopic analyses in 14 animals in each experimental group. The preganglionic nerve endings were localized mainly in the following three sites: the basal lamina part, the follicular lumen-junctional intercellular part, and the adrenaline cell-invaginated part. In the latter two parts, nerve endings and fibers had no envelope frequently, and in the former two parts, nerve endings sometimes showed the invagination complex. The frequency of nerve endings was highest in the follicular lumen-intercellular part, next highest in the basal lamina part and lowest in the A cell-invaginated part. The frequency of nerve endings in the basal lamina part was lower in the pinealectomy group than in the sham-pinealectomy group (P &lt; 0.021), and those in the other two parts showed opposite changes, more evidently in the A cell-invaginated part. Nerve ending profiles in the adrenaline cell-invaginated part--which displayed a more rounded shape--increased in size in the pinealectomy group (longer diameter: P &lt; 0.04; shorter diameter: P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, preganglionic nerve endings in the adrenal medulla of the golden hamster show differential morphological changes following PX depending on the intracellular part of A cells.
