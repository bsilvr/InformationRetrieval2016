The study of adrenal chromaffin of fish, Carassius auratus (Toleostei).In C. auratus the adrenal chramaffin tissue is situated around the posterior cardinal veins, in the head kidney. Chromaffin tissue consists of two types of cells containing secretory granules, adrenaline and nor adrenaline cells. The cells produced catecholamine hormones. Adrenaline cell contains electron-lucent granules, whereas nor adrenaline cells possesses electron-dense granules. Cholinergic fibers embedded in the head kidney innervated the chromaffin cell. Two types of secretory structures, synaptic vesicles and secretory granules are found within the presynaptic terminal. Secretory granules discharge their contests, as neuropeptide in non synaptic area of nerve terminal by exocytosis, whereas synaptic vesicles discharge their contents as neurotransmitters at the synaptic thickening (active zone) in the presynaptic terminal by exocytosis.
