Maximal and submaximal treadmill tests in a young adult with fragile-X syndrome.Fragile X syndrome is associated with expansion of a CGG triplet repeat in the FMR1 gene, which abolishes production of the FMRP protein. This abnormality is expressed as a number of neuro-endocrine disorders (the adrenal axis, macroorchidism) and the emergence of significant behavioural stress. Here, we report on the hormonal status of a young adult with fragile X syndrome, with a focus on catecholamine and cortisol changes during a submaximal treadmill test. The patient showed abnormally high epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations. During a submaximal incremental test, cortisol levels were higher than the laboratory reference range. Although the submaximal incremental test has a significant  stressful  effect, this young adult was able to complete the entire protocol without any maladaptive behaviour or withdrawal.
