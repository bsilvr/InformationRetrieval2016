Preparation of N-acetyl, tert-butyl amide derivatives of the 20 natural amino acids.N-Acetyl-AA(amino acid)-NHtBu derivatives of all 20 naturally occurring amino acids have been synthesized. Syntheses were performed via solution-phase methodology with yields that allow for access to gram quantities of substrates, in most cases. Syntheses include the coupling of a hindered amine, tert-butylamine, with each amino acid, either directly or in two steps using an activated ester isolated as an intermediate. The introduction of protecting groups was necessary in some cases. The development of synthetic sequences to access challenging substrates, such as the one derived from asparagine, are discussed.
