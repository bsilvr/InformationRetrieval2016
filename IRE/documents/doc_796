Neuroendocrine profiling in inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension rat strain with stress-sensitive arterial hypertension.The functions of the hypothalamic adrenal cortical and sympathetic adrenal medullary systems were studied in rats with inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension (ISIAH strain). A characteristic feature of the ISIAH strain is an increase in arterial blood pressure measured both under basal conditions and after restraint stress in particular. In the control ISIAH rats, the basal plasma ACTH concentration was slightly lower than that in the normotensive Wistar albino Glaxo (WAG) rats, and no differences were found in plasma corticosterone. However, the 0.5-h restraint stress produced higher activation of the adrenal cortex in the ISIAH rats. Gluco- and mineralocorticoid responses to the blood volume reduction stresses and ACTH and corticosterone responses to social stress were stronger in the ISIAH than in the control WAG rats. An increase in epinephrine content in adrenals in the basal state and enhanced response of the sympathetic adrenal medullary system to handling stress were observed in the ISIAH rats. Restraint stress produced significantly higher expression of genes encoding corticotropin-releasing hormone-mRNA in hypothalamus and proopiomelanocortin-mRNA in pituitary in the ISIAH than in the WAG rats. Restraint stress produced a decrease in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression (GR-mRNA) in hippocampus in the ISIAH, but not in the WAG rats. A persistent increase in tyrosine hydroxylase-mRNA in adrenals of the ISIAH rats was found. It is concluded that the ISIAH rat strain is an appropriate model of stress-sensitive hypertension with the predominant involvement of the hypothalamic adrenal cortical and sympathetic adrenal medullary systems in its pathogenesis.
