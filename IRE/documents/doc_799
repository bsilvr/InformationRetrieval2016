[Participation of annexins in Ca2+-regulated secretion of catecholamines]Secretion of catecholamines by adrenal medulla chromaffin cells occurs after their stimulation by nicotine or depolarization of plasma membrane. Adrenal medulla secrets mostly noradrenaline and adrenaline, both having pleyotropic action in the organism. Central role in regulation of exocytosis of catecholamines play calcium ions. Their intracellular concentration increases as a cell response to stimulus and creates signal to start secretion. Moreover, annexins are known to participate in regulation of biological membrane dynamics during intracellular transport processes, however their participation in secretion is less established then in endocytosis. Among twelve annexin subfamilies (AnxA1-A11 i A13) expressed in mammalian organisms only involvement of AnxA2 and AnxA6 in endocytosis is well documented. Some data suggests that annexins may play important functions also in Ca2+-regulated catecholamine secretion.
