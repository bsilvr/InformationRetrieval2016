Fasudil attenuates sympathetic nervous activity in the adrenal medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats.We investigated the effects of fasudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor, on hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats and on the catecholamine synthetic pathway. Ten-week-old male SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats were administered fasudil (10 mg/kg/day s.c.) for 4 days. Systolic blood pressure was measured using the tail-cuff method. Catecholamine levels were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography-ECD methods. Tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels were measured in Western blot analysis. The tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA level was measured using real-time PCR methods. Fasudil significantly decreased systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, but not in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Fasudil also significantly decreased catecholamine, tyrosine hydroxylase protein, and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels in the adrenal medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats. These results suggest that the depressor effects of fasudil on hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats may be related to inhibition of the catecholamine synthetic pathway.
