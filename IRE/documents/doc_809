Heterozygous alpha 2C-adrenoceptor-deficient mice develop heart failure after transverse aortic constriction.OBJECTIVE: Feedback regulation of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves is essential to control blood pressure, heart rate and contractility. Recent experiments in gene-targeted mice have suggested that alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors may operate in a similar feedback mechanism to control the release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. As heterozygous polymorphisms in the human alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor gene have been associated with cardiovascular disease including hypertension and chronic heart failure, we have sought to characterize the relevance of alpha(2C)-gene copy number for feedback control of epinephrine release in gene-targeted mice. METHODS: Adrenal catecholamine release, basal hemodynamics and susceptibility to develop heart failure after transverse aortic constriction were tested in mice with two copies (+/+), one copy (+/-) or no functional alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor gene (alpha(2C)-/-). RESULTS: Heterozygous alpha(2C)-receptor deletion (alpha(2C)+/-) resulted in a 43% reduction of adrenal alpha(2C) mRNA copy number and in a similar decrease in alpha(2)-receptor-mediated inhibition of catecholamine release from isolated adrenal glands in vitro. Urinary excretion of epinephrine was increased by 74+/-15% in alpha(2C)+/- and by 142+/-23% in alpha(2C)-/- mice as compared with wild-type control mice. Telemetric determination of cardiovascular function revealed significant tachycardia but no hypertension in alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor-deficient mice. alpha(2C)+/- mice were more susceptible to develop cardiac hypertrophy, failure and mortality after left-ventricular pressure overload than alpha(2C)+/+ mice. CONCLUSION: Adrenal alpha(2)-mediated feedback regulation of epinephrine secretion differs fundamentally from sympathetic feedback control. A single adrenoceptor subtype, alpha(2C), operates without a significant receptor reserve to prevent elevation of circulating epinephrine levels. This genetic model may provide an experimental basis to study the pathophysiology of alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor dysfunction in humans.
