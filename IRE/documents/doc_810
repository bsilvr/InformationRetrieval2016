Neurobiological alterations associated with traumatic stress.PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe the effects of traumatic stress on brain structure and function, and the relationship of these neurobiological changes to symptoms experienced after trauma. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to traumatic stress is associated with changes in the limbic system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and key monoamine neurotransmitters. Different neurobiological alterations can be linked to specific symptoms of hyperarousal, dissociation/numbing, and reexperiencing of the trauma. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Understanding what is happening in the brain can inform more targeted treatment for various symptoms that the individual may be experiencing.
