The role of prednisolone and epinephrine on gastric tissue and erythrocyte antioxidant status in adrenalectomized rats.It has been believed that overproduction of free radicals and/or deficiency of antioxidant systems, and stress hormones may play a role in etiopathogenesis of many diseases, including gastric ulcer. This study evaluated whether there was an effect of adrenalectomy on lipid peroxidation [malondialdehyde (MDA)] and antioxidant [superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione (GSH) levels] systems in gastric tissue and erythrocyte in rats. As well, the impacts of administration of prednisolone and epinephrine on these systems in adrenalectomized rats were investigated. Thirty-three rats were randomly grouped as sham-operated (group I), adrenalectomized (group II), adrenalectomized + prednisolone (group III) and adrenalectomized + epinephrine (group IV). After experimental procedures, blood and gastric tissues samples were taken from each animal in all groups. Colorimetric assays were employed to determine gastric tissue and erythrocyte levels of MDA and GSH, and SOD and GPX activities. Adrenalectomy in group II rats caused a marked decrease of SOD and GPX activities and MDA levels, and an increase of GSH levels in gastric tissue and erythrocyte, when compared to sham-operated rats. However, especially epinephrine injection after adrenalectomy resulted in a significantly increase of measured antioxidant enzyme activities and GSH levels in both gastric tissue and erythrocyte. These results indicate that adrenalectomy appeared to alter the levels of antioxidants and lipid peroxidation product in gastric tissue and erythrocyte. Thus, the present study provides a physiological regulatory role of adrenal gland in the maintenance of oxidant/antioxidant balance in gastric tissue and erythrocyte.
