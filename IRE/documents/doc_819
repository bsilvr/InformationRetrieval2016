Epinephrine-secreting pheochromocytoma in a normotensive woman with adrenal incidentaloma.Pheochromocytomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors that produce, metabolize, and usually secrete catecholamines. Although hypertension is a common presenting feature of pheochromocytoma, the tumors occur (or are present) in only 0.1% of patients with hypertension. The variability of symptoms and rarity of occurrence render these tumors difficult to diagnose; many are discovered incidentally during radiological examination or at autopsy. A patient is presented with a pheochromocytoma that was discovered incidentally when she presented with abdominal pain and a normal blood pressure.
