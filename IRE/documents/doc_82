Amino acid and mineral composition of protein and other components and their recovery yields from whole Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) using isoelectric solubilization/precipitation.Proteins and insolubles were recovered from whole Antarctic krill via novel isoelectric solubilization/precipitation using different pH treatments. The protein recovery yield was 45% to 50% (dry basis). The recovered proteins had higher (P &lt; 0.05) content of essential amino acids (EAAs) and non-EAAs as well as higher (P &lt; 0.05) ratio of total EAA/total AA than whole krill. The EAAs constituted almost 50% of total AAs. The least extreme pH treatments (pHs 3 and 12) yielded highest (P &lt; 0.05) content of EAAs. The quality of recovered proteins was high based on EAAs meeting FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations for adults and infants. The basic pH yielded proteins with the lowest (P &lt; 0.05) amount of minerals and the highest (P &lt; 0.05) amount of Ca, P, and Mg in the insolubles when compared to the acidic treatments. However, both basic and acidic treatments effectively removed minerals from recovered proteins without the removal of the exoskeleton before processing. Therefore, besides high-quality proteins, the insolubles may provide a mineral supplement in the animal diet.
