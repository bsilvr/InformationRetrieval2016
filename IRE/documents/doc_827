Adrenal cystic phaeochromocytoma: a case report.Cystic phaeochromocytoma is a rare occurrence. We report a case of a 42-year-old woman who presented with the cardinal symptoms of phaeochromocytoma with elevated serum catecholamine levels. Radiological investigations showed a cystic mass in the right adrenal. Right adrenalectomy through a subcosal incision was performed and pathological examination concluded to a cystic phaeochromocytoma. We discuss the pathophysiology of such cyst formation as well as differential diagnoses.
