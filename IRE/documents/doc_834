Identification of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase gene expression in stellate ganglia and its modulation by stress.Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT, EC 2.1.1.28) is the terminal enzyme of the catecholaminergic pathway converting noradrenaline to adrenaline. Although preferentially localized in adrenal medulla, evidence exists that PNMT activity and gene expression are also present in the rat heart, kidney, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, thymus, retina and different parts of the brain. However, data concerning PNMT gene expression in sympathetic ganglia are still missing. In this study, our effort was focused on identification of PNMT mRNA and/or protein in stellate ganglia and, if present, testing the effect of stress on PNMT mRNA and protein levels in this type of ganglia. We identified both PNMT mRNA and protein in stellate ganglia of rats and mice, although in much smaller amounts compared with adrenal medulla. PNMT gene expression and protein levels were also increased after repeated stress exposure in stellate ganglia of rats and wild-type mice. Similarly to adrenal medulla, the immobilization-induced increase was probably regulated by glucocorticoids, as determined indirectly using corticotropin-releasing hormone knockout mice, where immobilization-induced increase of PNMT mRNA was suppressed. Thus, glucocorticoids might play an important role in regulation of PNMT gene expression in stellate ganglia under stress conditions.
