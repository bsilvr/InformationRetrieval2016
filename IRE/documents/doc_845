Abnormal urinary steroid profiles in four hypertensive obese children.BACKGROUND: There is a poorly understood association between obesity and hypertension. We demonstrated abnormalities of adrenal androgen and cortisol metabolites in four hypertensive obese children. PATIENTS: Four males (aged 10 to 15 years) were evaluated for systolic blood pressures consistently above the 99.6th percentile. All were overweight with BMI ranging from 27-35. Clinical examinations, renal ultrasound and DMSA scans were normal. Plasma electrolytes, renin, aldosterone, cortisol, testosterone, ACTH and TSH were normal. 24-Hour urinary steroid profiles showed a generalised excess of adrenal androgen and cortisol metabolites in all cases. Relevant recognised disorders of adrenal androgen and cortisol metabolism were excluded. CONCLUSION: There is no clinical condition explaining these abnormal urinary steroid profiles. These results support previous findings and provide new data on abnormal urinary adrenal androgen excretion in obese hypertensive patients. Further studies may determine the relationship between obesity, hypertension and the observed abnormalities of urinary steroid excretion.
