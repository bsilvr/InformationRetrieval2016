Feedback inhibition of human scavenger receptor class B type I gene expression by glucocorticoid in adrenal and ovarian cells.Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) facilitates the reverse transport of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver via high-density lipoproteins. In steroidogenic tissues, SR-BI supplies cholesterol for steroid hormone production. We show here that the transcription of the human SR-BI gene is subject to feedback inhibition by glucocorticoid in adrenal and ovarian cells. SR-BI mRNA levels were increased in adrenals from corticosterone-insufficient Crh(-/-) mice, whereas corticosterone replacement by oral administration inhibited SR-BI gene expression in these mice. SR-BI mRNA levels were increased in adrenals from wild-type mice treated with metyrapone, a drug that blocks corticosterone synthesis. Experiments in adrenocortical H295R and ovarian SKOV-3 cells using cycloheximide and siRNA-mediated gene silencing revealed that glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of SR-BI gene transcription requires de novo protein synthesis and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). No direct binding of GR to the SR-BI promoter could be demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, suggesting an indirect mechanism of repression of SR-BI gene transcription by GR in adrenal cells. Deletion analysis established that the region of the human SR-BI promoter between nucleotides -201 and -62 is sufficient to mediate repression by glucocorticoid. This region contains putative binding sites for transcriptional repressors that could play a role in SR-BI gene regulation in response to glucocorticoid. In summary, this is the first report showing that glucocorticoid suppress SR-BI expression suggesting that steroidogenic tissues maintain steroid hormone homeostasis by prohibiting SR-BI-mediated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol uptake when the endogenous levels of glucocorticoid are elevated.
