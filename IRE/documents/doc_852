Diverse functions of Hedgehog signaling in formation and physiology of steroidogenic organs.Adrenal, testis, and ovary are steroidogenic organs derived from a common primordium that consists of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1)-positive precursor cells. SF1 not only defines the steroidogenic lineages in these organs but also controls their differentiation. Recent evidence implicates the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway as a downstream regulator of SF1 in the appearance of steroidogenic cells in these organs. The Hh signaling pathway serves as a common crosstalk component, yet has evolved diverse functions in the expansion and differentiation of the steroidogenic cells in a tissue-specific manner. The purpose of this review is to compare and contrast the different roles of Hh signaling in these three organs during development.
