Reversal of adrenal suppression with ciclesonide.BACKGROUND: Adrenal suppression secondary to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid use has been reported in children. METHODS: The authors report the use of ciclesonide to reverse adrenal suppression secondary to inhaled fluticasone use in four pediatric patients. RESULTS: In these four children, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function normalized after the patients were changed to ciclesonide, while good asthma control was maintained. CONCLUSIONS: Ciclesonide should be considered for the reversal of adrenal suppression secondary to the use of fluticasone, and perhaps other older inhaled corticosteroids as well.
