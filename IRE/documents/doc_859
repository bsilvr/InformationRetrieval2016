Ectopic Cushing's syndrome due to an adrenal ganglioneuroma.Background: Cushing's syndrome (CS), rare in children, is due to pituitary or, less frequently, to adrenocortical tumors. Ectopic adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion is exceptional. Method: A case of apparently ACTH-independent CS in a child is reported. Results: CS was due to an adrenal ganglioneuroma where neuroendocrine cells were immunopositive for ACTH responsible for the syndrome through a paracrine effect. Cortical cell hyperplasia was observed. Conclusion: Benign and differentiated tumors of the neural crest such as ganglioneuromas may be responsible for CS.
