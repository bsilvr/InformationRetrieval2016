Prepubertal adrenarchal androgens and animal protein intake independently and differentially influence pubertal timing.CONTEXT: Whether adrenarche impacts on pubertal development is controversial. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the associations of adrenal androgen (AA) secretion with early and late pubertal markers, independent of potential influences of dietary animal protein intake. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective cohort study of healthy free-living Caucasian children (n = 109) who provided both 24-h urine samples and 3-d weighed dietary records 1 and 2 yr before the biological age at take-off of the pubertal growth spurt (ATO). MEASUREMENTS: Twenty-four-hour excretion rates of androgen (C19) metabolites quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were measured. MAIN OUTCOMES: ATO, age at peak height velocity (APHV), age at menarche/voice break, duration of pubertal growth acceleration, and ages at Tanner stage 2 for breast (girls) and genital (boys) development (B2-G2) and pubic hair (PH2). RESULTS: Higher adrenarchal C19 steroids predicted earlier ages at Tanner stage 2 for pubic hair (P &lt; 0.0001) and B2-G2 (P = 0.009) as well as a shorter pubertal growth acceleration period (P = 0.001), independently of animal protein intake. Children with a higher AA secretion had a 1.5-yr earlier beginning of pubarche and a 0.8-yr earlier beginning of B2-G2 than those with a lower AA excretion. Furthermore, animal protein intake was independently negatively associated with ATO and APHV (P &lt; 0.05 each) and tended to be negatively associated with age at menarche/voice break (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: A higher animal protein intake may be involved in an earlier attainment of ATO and APHV, whereas a more intensive adrenarchal process may precipitate a shorter pubertal growth spurt and a notably earlier onset of breast and genital development in girls and boys, respectively.
