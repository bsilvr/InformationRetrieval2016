Perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa) of the inferior vena cava presenting as an adrenal mass.A 54-year-old woman had a mass located in the right suprarenal area. On imaging, this mass appeared to be infiltrating the inferior vena cava (IVC). Exploratory laparotomy was undertaken and excision of the tumour was done with the sleeve of the involved IVC. The mass turned out to be a perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa) on histopathological examination. This report describes previously reported cases of PEComa in brief and highlights the problems associated with the management of this tumour.
