Unexpected diagnosis for an adrenal tumor: synovial sarcoma.A 39-year-old woman presented with an incidentally discovered mass of the left adrenal fossa. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging did not show any other lesion. Histologically, this mass was composed of a dense proliferation of spindle cells with a fibrosarcomatous-like pattern. Immunohistochemistry using anticytokeratin showed some epithelial cells within the tumor. The diagnosis of primitive synovial sarcoma of the left adrenal fossa was confirmed by the presence of the characteristic t(X;18) translocation. Despite radiotherapy, several chemotherapies, and 2 other surgical resections, the patient died 30 months after the initial diagnosis. To our knowledge, this report constitutes the first described case of synovial sarcoma arising in the adrenal gland.
