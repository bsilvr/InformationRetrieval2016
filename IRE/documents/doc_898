Papillary endothelial hyperplasia of adrenal: case report.Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia is a benign and rare intravascular process thought to arise from an organizing thrombus. Involvement of the adrenal gland is extremely rare, with only one case reported in the literature. We report a case of this vascular lesion in the adrenal gland, treated with laparoscopic adrenalectomy.
