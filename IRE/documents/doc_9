Nutrient availability and lactogenic hormones regulate mammary protein synthesis through the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway.The nutritional and endocrine factors affecting protein translation in the bovine mammary gland, and the molecular mechanisms mediating their effects, are not well understood. The objective of this study was to assess the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in the regulation of mammary protein synthesis by nutrients and hormones. Mammary epithelial acini isolated from lactating dairy cows were treated in medium containing, alone or in combination, a mixture of AA or glucose and acetate (GA) as energy substrates, or a combination of the lactogenic hormones hydrocortisone, insulin, and prolactin (HIP). Changes in the rate of mammary protein synthesis and the phosphorylation state of components of the mTOR signaling pathway were measured. Mammary protein synthesis was 50% higher with increased availability of AA in medium. The presence of GA or treatment of mammary acini with HIP alone did not affect mammary protein synthesis. The stimulation of mammary protein synthesis by AA was enhanced by HIP treatment, but not by the presence of GA in medium. Treatment of mammary acini with HIP induced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B. This effect was augmented in the presence of either AA or GA in medium. The stimulation of mammary protein synthesis by AA and its enhancement by HIP were associated with increased phosphorylation of the mTOR substrates, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), and dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E. The results suggest that nutrients and hormones may modulate mammary protein synthesis through the mTOR signaling pathway.
