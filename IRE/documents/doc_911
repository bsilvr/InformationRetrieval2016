[A case of ectopic hepatocellular carcinoma]A 47-year-old otherwise healthy woman, presented elevation of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) levels at a general health checkup. Both HCV antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen were negative. A screening abdominal CT revealed no abnormal change. An abdominal MRI and repeated CT, however, revealed a 20-mm tumor adjacent to the inferior vena cava and adjacent to or involving the liver. A surgical resection of the tumor was performed. The tumor was adjacent to, but distinct from, the liver. The Capsule of the tumor was connected to the liver but it was distinct from hepatic, renal, and adrenal tissue. A histological examination yielded a diagnosis of moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, with positive staining of hepatocyte-specific antigen and AFP.
