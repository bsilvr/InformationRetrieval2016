Maternal and genetic factors in stress-resilient and -vulnerable rats: a cross-fostering study.Early environmental factors can modulate the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress, together with subsequent brain functions and emotional behaviors. Two rat strains, Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Fischer 344 (F344), are known to exhibit differences in HPA axis reactivity and anxiety behavior in response to restraint stress in adulthood. To investigate the contribution of maternal influences in determining HPA axis and behavioral responses to stress, a cross-fostering study was performed using stress-resilient (SD) or stress-susceptible (F344) strains. We found that SD rats adopted by either an SD (in-fostered) or an F344 (cross-fostered) dam and F344 rats adopted by an SD dam (cross-fostered) showed a suppression of the HPA axis response following 14 days of repeated restraint stress. In contrast, F344 rats adopted by an F344 dam (in-fostered) did not show such HPA axis habituation. We also found that F344 rats adopted by an F344 dam showed increased anxiety-related behaviors in social interaction and novelty-suppressed feeding tests as a result of the 14 days of restraint stress, while SD rats adopted by either an SD or an F344 dam and F344 rats adopted by an SD dam showed normal anxiety-related behaviors under the same experimental conditions. These results suggest that while genetic differences between SD and F344 strains account for some of the variations in stress vulnerability, maternal factors also contribute.
