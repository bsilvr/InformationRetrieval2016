Ascorbate defense system and response of steroid producing glands under reserpine treatment in albino rats (Rattus norvegicus).Reserpine functions as an anti-stress agent providing relaxation to animals under stressful conditions. An attempt was made to find out functions of reserpine in unstressed albino rats and its role in steroidogenesis. The effects of the drug (25 and 35 microg, im daily for 3-5 days) were observed by recording the changes in body weights, concentration of ascorbate (liver and adrenals) and cholesterol (liver, adrenal and testes) of the animals. A dose of 25 microg reserpine 3-5 days was ineffective as there were no significant changes after the treatment. On the other hand 35 microg reserpine was found to be effective because there was significant increase in body weights, levels of ascorbate and cholesterol in respective tissues after 3-5 days administration. Therefore it is clear that in unstressed animals reserpine is stimulatory for liver but inhibitory for adrenal and testes under high doses.
