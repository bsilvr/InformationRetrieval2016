Dalcetrapib: no off-target toxicity on blood pressure or on genes related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in rats.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association between torcetrapib and its off-target effects on blood pressure suggested a possible class-specific effect. The effects of dalcetrapib (RO4607381/JTT-705) and torcetrapib on haemodynamics and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) were therefore assessed in a rat model. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate were measured by telemetry in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) receiving torcetrapib 10, 40 or 80 mg kg(-1) day(-1); dalcetrapib 100, 300 or 500 mg(-1) kg day(-1); or vehicle (placebo) for 5 days. Expression of RAAS genes in adrenal gland, kidney, aorta and lung from normotensive rats following 5 days' treatment with torcetrapib 40 mg kg(-1) day(-1), dalcetrapib 500 mg kg(-1) day(-1) or vehicle was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. KEY RESULTS: Torcetrapib transiently increased mean AP in normotensive rats (+3.7 +/- 0.1 mmHg), whereas treatment in SHR resulted in a dose-dependent and sustained increase [+6.5 +/- 0.6 mmHg with 40 mg kg(-1) day(-1) at day 1 (P &lt; 0.05 versus placebo)], which lasted over the treatment period. No changes in AP or heart rate were observed with dalcetrapib. Torcetrapib, but not dalcetrapib, increased RAAS-related mRNAs in adrenal glands and aortas. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In contrast to torcetrapib, dalcetrapib did not increase blood pressure or RAAS-related gene expression in rats, suggesting that the off-target effects of torcetrapib are not a common feature of all compounds acting on cholesteryl ester transfer protein.
