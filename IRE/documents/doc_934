Compound 48/80 causes oxidative stress in the adrenal gland of rats through mast cell degranulation.Rats were intraperitoneally treated once with compound 48/80 (C48/80), a mast cell degranulator, (0.75 mg/kg). Serum serotonin, histamine and corticosterone levels increased 0.5 h after C48/80 treatment, but their increases were reduced thereafter. Adrenal total ascorbic acid (ascorbic acid plus dehydroascorbic acid), ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid levels decreased 0.5, 3 or 6 h after C48/80 treatment, adrenal lipid peroxide level increased at 3 and 6 h, adrenal non-protein-SH level decreased at 3 and 6 h and adrenal beta-tocopherol level decreased at 3 h. Ketotifen, a mast cell stabilizer (1 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally at 0.5 h before C48/80 treatment, attenuated all these changes found in the serum and adrenal at 3 h after treatment, while beta-tocopherol (250 mg/kg), administered orally at 0.5 h after C48/80 treatment, attenuated all these changes in the adrenal tissue. These results indicate that C48/80 causes oxidative stress in rat adrenal gland through mast cell degranulation.
