Model peptide-based system used for the investigation of metal ions binding to histidine-containing polypeptides.The reaction of histidine-containing polypeptides with toxic and essential metals and the molecular mechanism of complexation has yet to be determined, particularly with respect to the conformational changes of the interacting macromolecules. Therefore, a system of oligopeptides containing histidine residues in various positions of Ala or Gly sequences has been designed and used in heavy metal comparatively binding experiments. The role of spacing residues (Gly and Ala repeats) in selecting the various conformations was investigated. The newly synthesized peptides and metal ion adducts have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as well as electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and circular dichroism (CD). The analysis of CD-spectra of the four peptides in water revealed that the secondary structure depends much on the position of each amino acid in the peptide backbone. Our peptides system reveals various binding mechanisms of metal ions to peptides depending on the position of histidine residue and the corresponding conformations of Ala or Gly sequences. Biological and medical consequences of conformational changes of metal-bound peptides are further discussed. Thus, the binding of heavy metals to four peptides may serve as a model system with respect to the conformational consequences of the metal addition on the amino acid repeats situated in prion protein.
