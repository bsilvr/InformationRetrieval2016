Structural characterization of teichoic acids from Lactobacillus brevis.Teichoic acids are a major constituent of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Structural characterization of lipoteichoic and teichoic acids isolated from Lactobacillus brevis was undertaken using 1D and 2D NMR experiments as well as chemical methodology. Compositional analysis indicated the presence of high amounts of glycerol, glucose, and alanine. In the case of LTA octadecenoic acid was also detected. The basic LTA/WTA structure was identified as 1,3-poly(glycerol phosphate) nonstoichiometrically substituted at C-2 of the glycerol residues with D-Ala or alpha-D-Glc. In the case of LTA a higher amount of Ala could be detected and partial alanylation at position C-6 of the Glc could also be observed.
