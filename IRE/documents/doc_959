Control of impurities in L-aspartic acid and L-alanine by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a corona charged aerosol detector.In this study a reversed phase ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method using charged aerosol detection (CAD) was developed and fully validated for the pharmaceutical quality control of L-aspartic acid (Asp). With a slight modification, the method also allows the evaluation of related substances in L-alanine (Ala). The method enables simultaneous control of related amino acids and of possibly occurring organic acids contaminants. A minimum limit of quantification of 0.03% could be achieved for all occurring related substances. Moreover, the detector sensitivity of the CAD was compared with an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD). Depending on the analyte the CAD was found to be 3.6-42 times more sensitive than the ELSD. The HPLC method was applied to the purity testing of 8 samples of pharmaceutical grade and reagent grade Asp and of 12 samples of Ala supplied by various manufacturers. Both substances were found to be of high purity (greater than 99.8% for Asp and greater than 99.9% for Ala). Malic acid and Ala were the major impurities in Asp. Asp and glutamic acid (Glu) were the only detectable impurities in Ala.
