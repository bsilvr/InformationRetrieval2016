Homochiral, helical metal-organic framework structures organized by strong, non-covalent pi-pi stacking interactions.A new trifunctional ligand, L(ala), containing a carboxylate donor group, a homochiral center derived from L-alanine and a strong pi-pi stacking, 1,8-naphthalimide synthon, has been used to prepare the copper(II) complex [Cu(L(ala))2(4,4'-bipy)(H2O)2].4.25H2O that has a homochiral, helical, supramolecular metal-organic framework 3-D structure, organized in one dimension solely by strong non-covalent forces.
