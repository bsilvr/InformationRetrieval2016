Theoretical and experimental studies on alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides: design of a 14/12-helix from peptides with alternating (S)-C-linked carbo-epsilon-amino acid [(S)-epsilon-Caa((x))] and L-ala.An (S)-C-linked carbo-epsilon-amino acid [(S)-epsilon-Caa((x))] was prepared from the known (S)-delta-Caa. This monomer was utilized together with l-Ala to give novel alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides in 1:1 alternation. Conformational analysis on penta- and hexapeptides by NMR (in CDCl(3)), CD, and MD studies led to the identification of robust 14/12-mixed helices. This is in agreement with the data from a theoretical conformational analysis on the basis of ab initio MO theory providing a complete overview on all formally possible hydrogen-bonded helix patterns of alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides with 1:1 backbone alternation. The  new motif  of a mixed 14/12-helix was predicted as most stable in vacuum. Obviously, the formation of ordered secondary structures is also possible in peptide foldamers with amino acid constituents of considerable backbone lengths. Thus, alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides expand the domain of foldamers and allow the introduction of desired functionalities via the alpha-amino acid constituents.
